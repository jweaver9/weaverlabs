In one, Obergefell v. Hodges, a majority of the Su-preme Court declared that same-sex couples have theconstitutional right to marry.1 Those who celebrated the deci-sion, as well as those who derided it, recognized it as a majorevent in the history of constitutional law. Newspapers and me-dia outlets around the world covered it, advocates on bothsides of the issue rallied outside the Supreme Court, and legalscholars produced thousands of pages of commentary. 2Just eleven days before the Supreme Court handed downObergefell, however, it issued an opinion in Kerry v. Din.3 Un-like Obergefell, this decision went largely unnoticed by thepress, courts, lawyers, and the public. Din concerned not theright to marry but the rights ofmarriage. In particular, it askedwhether a person has a constitutional liberty interest in livingwith his or her spouse. In Din, a United States citizen claimedthat the federal government's arbitrary denial of a visa to herhusband violated procedural due process.4 Although Din losther case-Justice Anthony Kennedy's concurrence held thatshe had been given a good enough reason for her husband's1 135 S. Ct. 2584 (2015).2 See, e.g., Adam Liptak, 'Equal Dignity', N.Y. TIMES, June 27, 2015, at Al(reporting on the Obergefell ruling and the Justices' varying viewpoints on thedecision).3 135 S. Ct. 2128 (2015) (plurality opinion).4 Id. at 2133.502 [Vol. 103:501THE RIGHTS OF MARRIAGEexclusion-six of the Justices assumed for purposes of the casethat a U.S. citizen does have a due process liberty interest inhis or her marriage to a noncitizen.5 Put differently, the right tomarry means little if individuals cannot enjoy the benefits ofmarriage.When the Supreme Court issued the Din decision, few no-ticed. Its brief mentions in the press were soon eclipsed by thedecision in Obergefell a few days later. Now, however, Din ishaving a rebirth. President Donald J. Trump has issued execu-tive orders suspending immigration from certain countries andbroadening deportations.6 Although these orders continue tobe rescinded and supplanted with new versions, they share acommon characteristic-they directly implicate the marriagerights at issue in Dir. The family reunification claims articu-lated in Din are relatively uncharted waters for constitutionalfamily law, and ones that many people, citizens and nonci-tizens alike, are mobilizing in suits challenging PresidentTrump's orders.7 In time, Din may emerge as a constitutionalprecedent equal to Obergefell in historical and legalimportance.So far, however, Obergefel has been the decision that liti-gants, lawyers, legislators, and judges have turned to in adju-dicating family constitutional cases. Scholars, too, havefocused on Obergefell since the Court issued its Obergefelldecision, over one thousand law review articles and notes havediscussed the case.\" Given this enormous volume, it is difficultto do justice to the range of responses, but much of the schol-arship falls roughly into two camps-scholars who see inObergefell hope for the expansion of constitutional family rightsand LGBTQ rights more broadly9 and those who see5 Id. at 2139 (Alto, J., concurring) (holding that Din's husband's visa denialsatisfied due process).6 See Exec.

Reading Obergefell with Din under-cuts this assumption.In contrast, so far, Din has been cited primarily in thelitigation concerning President Trump's recent executive orderssuspending immigration from several predominantly Muslimcountries.\" Courts and lawyers understand Din as an opinionabout the role of the \"plenary power doctrine\" in immigrationcases, and that doctrine's relationship to procedural due pro-cess-and so it is.1 2 It is also, however, an opinion about mar-riage rights, and those rights must be understood within thecontext of the expansion and constitutionalization of familyrights in the last fifty years.' 3 Reading Din with Obergefellreveals this broader meaning.affirmative obligation to provide recognition of adult intimate relationships assupported in Obergefell); Laurence H.

Meyer, The Constitutionalization of Family Law, 42FAM. L.Q. 529, 531-51 (2008) (describing evolution of constitutional familyrights).504THE RIGHTS OF MARRIAGEThis Article argues that neither Obergefell nor Din can beunderstood fully without the other. The constitutional issuesin the cases-the right to marry and the rights of marriage-stem from the same text and doctrines, implicate the samerelationships, and reflect cultural understandings of the mean-ing of marriage and family. The Justices were presumably cir-culating drafts of both opinions during the spring of 2015, and,indeed, traces of the rhetoric and reasoning in each case ap-pear in the other.Two aspects of Obergefell and Din are foregroundedthrough this synthesized reading. First, Justice Kennedy'sObergefell opinion reads differently alongside Din and comes offas simultaneously broader in application and narrower inscope. Reading his Obergefell majority alongside his Din con-currence calls into question the scope of the family rights hewould consider protected as a constitutional liberty interest.Reading Kennedy's Obergefell majority alone could lead areader to assume-wrongly-that his views of marriage rightsare expansive; reading Din alone could lead a reader to believe-again, wrongly-that they are stingy. Read together, JusticeKennedy's decisions in Obergefell and Din reveal an under-standing of marriage as a form of self-expression and an exer-cise of responsible citizenship, an institution that thegovernment has an interest in fostering because of the serviceit does for society. Given that Justice Kennedy remains, atleast for now, the Court's \"swing vote\" and is likely to play animportant role in constitutional litigation in cases involvingeverything from family reunification to family-based citizenshipto religious exemptions to LGBTQ-protective laws, understand-ing the scope of his theory is critical for litigants, scholars, andcourts alike.Second, reading Din and Obergefetl together better eluci-dates the positions of the other Justices who wrote in thosecases, enabling a better understanding of how they will ap-proach future constitutional family claims. Justice StephenBreyer's Din dissent, for example, is markedly dissimilar fromthe majority opinion he joined in Obergefet, in ways that sug-gest a very different constitutional status for marriage that issimultaneously broader than the right protected in Obergefelland yet less historically embedded. Similarly, Justices Scalia,Thomas, Alito, and Roberts each wrote dissents in Obergefetlbut divided in their reasoning for denying the family reunifica-tion claim at issue in Dir. In that case, Justices Scalia,Thomas, and Roberts resisted any recognition of a due process2018] 505506 CORNELL LAW REVIEW [Vol. 103:501interest in family reunification, but Justice Alito joined JusticeKennedy's concurrence, which assumed that such a right exis-ted. Read together, these two cases identify different fault linesbetween the Justices than those that are visible in either casealone.At first glance, this Article may appear to be making apedestrian, even obvious, point-that cases must be read to-gether, and no single Supreme Court case adequately describesthe law. Obergefell, however, has been read by most scholarsin light of Justice Kennedy's other LGBTQ rights opinions, in-cluding Romer v. Evans, Lawrence v. Texas, and United Statesv. Windsor, but not in light of Din.14 In fact, most family lawand constitutional law scholars have completely ignored Din,15or treated it as a specialized immigration case. 16 The argument14 517 U.S. 620 (1996); 539 U.S. 558 (2003); 133 S.

Corcoran, #Love Wins* *But Only if You Marry One of Us, 2015 UTAH L.REv.

Family, The Executive Power of Process in Immigration Law,91 CHI.-KENT L. REv. 59, 83 (2016) (using Din as an \"illustration of the force ofminimal process in immigration law\"); Kevin R.

Long Live Plenary Power, 114 MICH. L. REV. FIRST IMPRESSIONS 21, 26-28(2015) (reading Din to reveal a dismantling of the plenary power doctrine aroundprocedural due process rights but a continuation of the doctrine around substan-tive rights); Michael Kagan, When Immigrants Speak: The Precarious Status ofNon-Citizen Speech under the First Amendment, 57 B.C. L. REv. 1237, 1283 (2016)(citing Din as an example of the Court's \"reluctance to review substantive immi-gration decisions\"); David A. Martin, Why Immigration's Plenary Power DoctrineEndures, 68 OKLA. L. REv. 29, 50 n.59 (2015) (characterizing Din as a \"goldenopportunity\" to make inroads into the plenary power doctrine); Adrian Vermeule,Deference and Due Process, 129 HARV. L. REv. 1890, 1893 (2016) (citing Kennedy'sDin concurrence as an admirable example of judicial restraint and deference toagency determinations of what process is due).THE RIGHTS OF MARRIAGEthis Article makes is not that cases in general must be readtogether, but that reading Obergefell and Din together is partic-ularly crucial for understanding constitutional family law inthis moment, both because of the salience of family reunifica-tion claims in the present political climate and because theJustices who wrote it did so while they were simultaneouslydrafting their opinions in ObergefelL Scholars of constitutionalfamily law who treat Din as external to their field miss its im-portant contribution to the Court's constitutional family juris-prudence; scholars of immigration who ignore Obergefell willmiss the nuances of the positions the Justices each took in Din.This synthesized reading of Obergefell and Din producestwo practical results. First, Obergefells approval of marriageover non-marriage may be limited to the facts of that case, andmay not lead to increased discrimination against the unmar-ried, or against LGBTQ people in other contexts. Second, theSupreme Court may be close to recognizing expressly one par-ticular \"right of marriage\"-the right to family reunification.This Article proceeds as follows. Part I tells the stories ofObergefell v. Hodges and Kerry v. Din, highlighting the factsthat are important to understanding the constitutional importof the opinions. Part II works through the opinions of the Jus-tices in Obergefell, and Part III does the same for Din, illuminat-ing the Justices' theories of constitutional family law andshowing how the Din opinions undercut some of the apparentimplications of ObergefelL Part IV offers some observationsabout how these two opinions, taken together, point a differentway forward for both the scope of constitutional family rightsgenerally and the right to family reunification in particular.IOBERGEFELL AND DINObergefell and Din both involved petitioners who claimedrights under the constitution based on their intimate relation-ships. In Obergefel, the petitioners were sixteen people insame-sex relationships who either wanted their marriages rec-ognized by their home states or wanted to be able to marry intheir home states.1 7 In Din, the petitioner was a U.S. citizenwho had attempted to secure a visa for her foreign husband sothat he could join her in the United States, and who wanted tobetter understand why her petition had been denied, presuma-bly so that she could attempt to rebut the government's posi-17 Obergefell v. Hodges, 135 S. Ct. 2584, 2593 (2015).2018]1 507CORNELL LAW REVIEWtion.18 The contours of constitutional family law doctrine wereat the heart of each case, but the factual contexts meant thateach case foregrounded different aspects of the petitioners'constitutional claims.A. Obergefell v. HodgesThe case known as Obergefell v. Hodges was, in actuality, agroup of cases from several district courts consolidated by theSixth Circuit Court of Appeals.' 9 The cases involved a varietyof petitioners. The lead petitioner, Jim Obergefell, had a partic-ularly compelling story. He and his partner of over twentyyears, John Arthur, were residents of Ohio.20 Because Ohiodid not recognize same-sex marriage, they could not marrythere.2 1 John had been diagnosed with amyotrophic 1Lteralsclerosis, otherwise known as ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease, aprogressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cellsin the brain and spinal cord. 22 In 2013, the U.S. SupremeCourt issued its decision in United States v. Windsor, in whichit invalidated the federal Defense of Marriage Act. 2 3 UnderWindsor, the federal government could no longer refuse to rec-ognize same-sex marriages. 24 Obergefell and Arthur decidedthey wanted to marry, and, as they could not in Ohio, theyrented a medically equipped plane, flew to BWI Airport in Mary-land, and were married on the tarmac because Arthur was tooill to leave the plane. 25A few weeks later, Obergefell filed a lawsuit in federal courtchallenging Ohio's refusal to recognize the couple's marriage. 26In particular, they wanted Obergefell to be listed as Arthur'sspouse on the last official document of his life-his death cer-tificate. On that form, the state insisted it needed to refer toArthur as \"single,\" leaving blank the line for surviving spouse.Obergefell and Arthur made particularly sympathetic andcompelling plaintiffs, but so were many of the other petitionersin the case. Michael DeLeon and Greg Bourke, for example,had been a couple since 1981, raised two children together,18 See Kerry v. Din, 135 S. Ct. 2128, 2131 (2015).19 Obergefell, 135 S.

Ct. at 2594.26 See id. at 2594-95.[Vol. 103:501508THE RIGHTS OF MARRIAGEand married in Canada in 2004, but their home state of Ken-tucky would not recognize their marriage. 2 7 They wanted theirmarriage recognized so that Bourke's name could be added tothe birth certificates of their children. Similarly, Kim Franklinand Tammy Boyd had lived in a committed relationship foreight years before the litigation began. They had married onthe beach in Connecticut in 2010, returned to Kentucky, andwanted Kentucky to recognize their out-of-state marriage. 2 8Although the facts varied from case to case, the connecting linkbetween all of the couples was their claim that the state shouldrecognize their relationships so that they could be eligible forthe benefits or other forms of recognition granted by the stateto married couples alone. It was not the stigma of being re-fused marital status that was the basis of their injury-al-though surely this contributed to their sense that the law wasunjust. Nor were the couples asking to be permitted to have asame-sex relationship; previous cases, most notably Lawrencev. Texas, had established that private same-sex intimacy wasconstitutionally protected. 2 9 Instead, it was the public recogni-tion of their relationship and the particular public benefits ac-companying that recognition that the petitioners sought.The claims made by the Obergefell petitioners can be un-derstood as the last step of a long series of cases leading up toit. Constitutional family law had existed for decades, beginningperhaps with the establishment of state authority over familylaw in Maynard v. HL30 Subsequent constitutional familycase law has also imposed a norm of gender neutrality on theallocation of marriage-based benefits and family law rules, 3 127 Bourke v. Beshear & Love v.

Shevin,2018] 509CORNELL LAW REVIEW [Vol. 103:501curtailed discrimination against nonmarital children, 32 and ar-ticulated a zone of privacy around decisions regarding repro-duction.3 3 Most importantly for the Obergefell petitioners, theCourt established marriage as a fundamental right, strikingdown statutes that abridged the right of marriage in variousways, from requiring parents to demonstrate that they werecurrent on their child support payments before marrying todenying female prison inmates the right to marry to banninginterracial marriage.34 These cases, however, did not articulatethe definitional question posed by Obergefell-marriage is afundamental right, but is same-sex marriage really marriage?Obergefell, like Windsor before it, built on these establishedright-to-marry precedents by knitting them together with the416 U.S. 351, 351-55 (1974) (holding that a state tax law that favors women maybe permissible \"if the discrimination is founded upon a reasonable distinction, ordifference in state policy.\" Id. at 355.

The most relevant here isMoore v. City of East Cleveland, a case in which a grandmotherchallenged a zoning law that prohibited her from living with hertwo grandsons, each of whom had different parents.3 5 A plu-rality of the Court found that this regulation was impermissiblebecause it chose to regulate \"by slicing deeply into the familyitself.\"3 6 Although Moore involved a woman and her grandchil-dren, not a married couple, its fundamental concern was withthe right of family members to cohabit with one another. Thisconcern is distinct from the right to enter into a legal relation-ship, such as marriage. Instead, it focuses on what freedomsthe familial relationship affords to the members of the family.This concern lies at the heart of the Supreme Court's other2015 constitutional family law case, Kerry v. Din.B. Kerry v. DinUnlike Jim Obergefell, Fauzia Din has not become a house-hold name, nor did the case bearing her name garner the con-tinuous world-wide media coverage and intense, sustainedscholarly attention heaped on Obergefell. Din's case, however,also had a compelling factual story and resulted in opinionsthat likely contain the seeds of the Court's future constitutionalfamily jurisprudence.Fauzia Din, a naturalized U.S. citizen, originally came tothe United States as an asylum-seeker from Afghanistan.3 7 Po-litical asylum is granted to an individual who can demonstratepast persecution or a \"well-founded fear\" of suffering persecu-tion should she be returned to her home country.3 8 Ms. Din35 431 U.S. 494, 496-97 (1977).36 Id. at 498; see also U.S. Dep't of Agric. v.

Once she obtained asylum,she was eligible to apply to become a citizen after residingcontinuously in the United States for a minimum of fiveyears. 40 After obtaining her U.S. citizenship, she married Kan-ishka Berashk, a man also from Afghanistan whom she hadknown since childhood.4 1One of the privileges of U.S. citizenship is the ability topetition for a visa for an immediate relative (a spouse, child, orparent). 42 This visa allows the relative to travel to the UnitedStates and live there with \"permanent resident\" status (and,eventually, apply for U.S. citizenship).4 3 When Fauzia Din ini-tially petitioned for an immediate relative visa for Berashk, thepetition was granted.44 The next step was for Berashk to travelto the nearest U.S. consulate (the consulate in Islamabad, Pa-kistan). 45 Berashk had his interview at the consulate and thenwaited. He heard nothing back from the State Department foralmost a year. 46Din contacted her congressman, who, in turn, demandedan explanation from the State Department.47 It sent a denialletter, stating that Berashk was inadmissible under 8 U.S.C.§ 1182 (a). The statute in question is the piece of the Immigra-tion and Nationality Act that lists every category of person whois inadmissible to (prohibited from entering) the United States.At twenty-four pages long, the statute is detailed, convoluted,and wide-ranging, including as inadmissible everyone frompeople who have not had required vaccines, to money launder-ers, to persons who are \"likely .. . to become a public charge.\"4 8It would be impossible to know, based on a mere reference tothe statute, which subsection the government believed was ap-plicable to Berashk.39 Brief in Opposition at 3, Din, 135 S.

Thesection it identified, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(3)(B), states that indi-viduals involved in terrorist activity are inadmissible. At firstglance, this level of specificity might seem to be enough. Butlike the inadmissibility statute in general, the anti-terrorismprovisions are extremely broad and difficult to understand. Aperson can be inadmissible for having actually engaged in whatwould be commonly understood as terrorist activity, for exam-ple, hijacking an airplane or bombing a public place, but couldalso be inadmissible for giving a terrorist a place to stay, pro-viding him with money or food, or passing on a message fromone terrorist to another. To make things even more confusing,a \"terrorist organization\" includes, under the statute, a \"groupof two or more individuals, whether organized or not, whichengages in, or has a subgroup which engages in [terrorist activ-ity].\"50 A person can be inadmissible for aiding such a groupeven if he did not know that he was aiding terrorists, if he\"reasonably should [have] know[n].\"5 1 In short, the \"what\" of\"terrorist activity\" can include seemingly innocuous activity,the \"who\" of \"terrorist organization\" can include two unorgan-ized individuals, and the \"how\" can include no actual knowl-edge of terrorism. Given the broad swath of activities thatcould lead to a finding of inadmissibility, a visa applicant whowas erroneously found to have engaged in \"terrorist activity\"might very well have no way to guess as to the basis of thefinding.If the statute the State Department identified as makingBerashk inadmissible was broad, the discretion afforded to theconsular officer reviewing his case was even broader. Consularofficers are granted extraordinarily wide berth when makingdecisions about whom to admit to the United States. The stat-ute in question in Berashk's case, for example, states that aperson is inadmissible if the consular officer \"has reasonableground to believe\" that the person \"is engaged in or is likely toengage after entry in any terrorist activity.\" 52 Berashk mayhave been excluded not because the consular officer knew ofprior terrorist activity (defined in the very broad way outlined49 See Brief of Appellant, supra note 41, at 9.50 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(3)(B)(vi).51 Id. § 1182(a)(3)(B)(iv).52 Id. § 1182(a)(3)(B)((II).2018]1 513CORNELL LAW REVIEWabove), but because the officer suspected that Berashk waslikely to engage in such activity. The law provides no mecha-nism for appealing a consular decision.53 The absence of anappeal process makes it impossible for a person whose visa isdenied to effectively contest the denial, or, often, to even dis-cover the reason for it.In Berashk's case, neither he nor Din knew the reason forthe denial.5 4 Berashk had been employed as a postal clerk forthe Afghan government, including during the time when theTaliban was in power.55 It is possible that the consular officerunderstood paid employment by the Taliban to constitute \"ter-rorist activity.\" 56 The State Department, however, refused tooffer any factual explanation for the denial, pointing simply tothe text of the statute itself.Din responded by suing the State Department. Her claimwas an interesting one: she did not demand that Berashk beadmitted to the United States, but rather that the State Depart-ment provide her with a more detailed explanation of why hecould not be, presumably so that she could rebut it if the gov-ernment had inaccurate information.Fauzia Din, like Jim Obergefell and the other Obergefellpetitioners, framed her case as one about marriage rights. Butthe focus of her claim was different. Where Obergefell and hisco-petitioners invoked the right to marry in order to accesscertain benefits, Din invoked the right to exercise the benefitsof marriage. Jim Obergefell was seeking entry into a statusrelationship that brings with it certain rights, including theright to petition for a foreign spouse's visa. In contrast, FauziaDin had already exercised the right to marry; she wanted thegovernment to not stand in the way of her enjoyment of therelationship it already recognized. Because Ms. Din (or herlawyers) understood that the right to live in the same place asone's spouse could not be absolute (prisoners, for example, areseparated from their spouses by walls; soldiers by war), shearticulated her claim as a procedural one. It flowed from asubstantive right to the companionship of one's spouse, butthe remedy she sought was due process-procedural protec-tions to ensure that this right would not be infringed uponwithout good reason and fair consideration.53 Brief for the Petitioners at 7, Kerry v.

In contrast, Din could not be decided purely byextending the logic of prior cases to a new class of plaintiffs.The cases most analogous to Din were cases about parents orother caretakers and children, not spouses, and custody andzoning, not admission as a permanent resident.

Instead, she made astructural constitutional claim and argued that the regulationsused were not \"reasonable.\" 6 7 Justice Robert Jackson, how-ever, joined in dissent by Justices Hugo Black and Felix Frank-furter, articulated a family reunification rationale for Knauff'sclaims. Congress, he argued, has the power to exclude aliens.But it does not have the power to authorize \"an abrupt andbrutal exclusion of the wife of an American citizen without ahearing.\"68Similarly, in Shaughnessy v. Meze, the Supreme Courtupheld the exclusion of another noncitizen, also the spouse of aU.S. citizen.6 9 Both Knauff and Mezet were decided during theCold War, during an era of heightened suspicion against East-ern Europeans and suspected communists. Both were alsodecided prior to the line of cases decided in the 1970s thatestablished a procedural due process right in expectancy inter-ests. Under these cases, even if an entitlement is not a funda-mental right, if the government has created an expectancy tothe entitlement, it must provide procedural due process whendenying it. 7 0 Knauff and Mezei were also decided prior to theright-to-marry cases, such as Loving, Zablocki, and Turner, aswell as the cases involving families living together, such asMoore and Moreno.When the Court heard Kerry v. Din, then, it was perfectlypositioned to ask again the question it had ignored in Knauffand Mezei-do U.S. citizens have a constitutional interest inliving with their spouses?-in light of an expanded under-standing of the constitutional protection afforded to marriage.Put differently, now that interracial couples, prisoners, andmen who owe child support all have a right to marry, what isthe scope of the rights of marriage?65 338 U.S. 537, 540 (1950).66 Id. at 544.67 Id. at 542 (discussing plaintiffs claim that the statute in question andaccompanying regulations contained unconstitutional delegations of legislativepower).68 Id. at 550 (Jackson, J., dissenting).69 345 U.S. 206, 217 (Black, J., dissenting) (stating that \"[h]e wanted to go tohis wife and home in Buffalo\").To See Kerry v.

Flores,507 U.S. 292, 302 (1993)).20 181] 5 17CORNELL LAW REVIEWC. Overlapping Constitutional Family TheoriesIn both Obergefell and Din, the Court was faced with thequestion of whether it should expand its existing constitutionalfamily law jurisprudence to include new factual scenarios.Obergefell required the Court to decide whether same-sex mar-riage fell within the definition of \"marriage\" for constitutionalpurposes, and whether discrimination in access to marriagebased on sexual orientation was constitutionally permissible.Din, on the other hand, demanded that the Court decidewhether existing precedents regarding the right to live withone's biological family members should be expanded to includethe right to live with one's spouse, and whether the right tomarry and procedural due process cases of the 1960s, 1970s,and 1980s called into question the harsh approach taken bythe Court with regard to immigrant spouses during the ColdWar. Both cases required the Justices to articulate their un-derstanding of why marriage is constitutionally protected-inother words, to develop a legal theory of marriage.Despite their different postures, Obergefell and Din con-cerned overlapping legal claims. Admittedly, they have differ-ent emphases. Obergefell is about the right to enter into astatus, and Din is about the right to access certain benefitsbased on that status. The lines between status and benefits,however, are murky, and when pressed, the subject areas ofthe two cases blur.Consider, for example, the claims the Obergefell plaintiffs,as well as the plaintiffs in many other marriage rights cases,were making. These claims were for marital recognition for itsown sake, but also for the tangible benefits marriage provides.Indeed, prior to Obergefel, many states had attempted to ac-commodate same-sex couples' demands for access to benefitsby creating other, non-marital statuses, such as domestic part-nerships or civil unions, that would provide some or all of thebenefits of marriage. 7 ' The right at issue in Din-to live in thesame country as one's spouse-is, like the rights at issue in themarriage equality cases, a right that flows from marital status.Thus, another way of understanding Din is as a case that fo-cuses on one of the particular rights that have been bundled71 See, e.g., Hollingsworth v. Perry, 133 S. Ct. 2652, 2659 (2013) (describingCalifornia domestic partnership act, which gave domestic partners \"the samerights, protections, and benefits, and shall be subject to the same responsibilities,obligations, and duties under law . . . as are granted to and imposed uponspouses\" (quoting Cal. Fam. Code § 297.5(a) (West 2004)).518 [Vol. 103:501THE RIGHTS OF MARRIAGEinto the status of marriage, rather than the entire bundle.72 Nocourt has ever determined which rights, bundled into the sta-tus of marriage, are necessary to make marriage \"marriage.\"Surely, if the right to access health insurance through one'sspouse were taken away, or if spouses could no longer refuse totestify against one another, their \"right to marry\" would nothave been abridged.If one right were to be found fundamental to the exercise ofthe right to marry, however, it would likely be the right to livewith one's spouse. Certainly, this right is sometimes overrid-den by other, more pressing needs, as when one spouse isincarcerated or deployed in the armed services, but for mostspouses, marriage would mean little if there was no physicalproximity. As in Moore, abridging the right of married people tolive with one another would regulate \"by slicing deeply into thefamily itself.\"7 3 Thus, even though Obergefell and Din some-times draw from different lines of cases, the theories underly-ing them, and their significance for constitutional family rights,are intertwined.In Obergefell, Justice Kennedy wrote for the majority. Fourother Justices-Breyer, Ginsburg, Kagan, and Sotomayor-joined his opinion. None of these other Justices wrote sepa-rately. We cannot know for certain if they agreed with JusticeKennedy's reasoning or had other reasons for joining the opin-ion, although Justice Ginsburg has stated that she thought \"itwas more powerful\" for the Court to speak with one voice.74Some scholars have speculated about how the opinion mighthad been different had it been authored by one of the other fourjoining Justices.7 5 Four Justices dissented-Roberts, Alito,Scalia, and Thomas. In contrast to the unified majority, each ofthe dissenters wrote his own, sometimes quite lengthy,opinion.Din, although it produced fewer opinions than Obergefell,was in one respect more complex. Unlike Obergefell, Din did72 See James Herbie DiFonzo, Unbundling Marriage, 32 HOFSTRA L. REv. 31,31 (2003) (observing that \"[mlarriage is emerging as a 'bundle' of legal benefits andburdens\"); cf. Strauss, supra note 9, at 1732 (arguing that the right to marrycannot be understood as a \"[blundle of [s]imple [c]laim [rights\").73 Moore v. City of E.

Although five justices agreedon an outcome (Din lost her case), they could not agree on thereasoning. Justice Scalia's plurality opinion garnered only twoadditional votes, from Justices Thomas and Roberts. JusticeKennedy's concurrence was signed by Justice Alito. 76 Theprecedential value of Din is therefore more speculative.Din also presents something Obergefell did not-an opinionby Justice Breyer, one of the silent Justices in Obergefel Thisdissenting opinion, joined by Justices Ginsburg, Kagan, andSotomayor, is notable because its theory of marriage differsgreatly from Kennedy's Obergefell majority. Reading Obergefelland Din together produces a very different impression thanreading Obergefell alone. Din provides a window into how atleast one of those Justices who remained silent in Obergefellunderstands marriage, provides differentiation between theJustices who dissented in Obergefell, and also underscores thelimits of Justice Kennedy's approach.IIOBERGEFELL'S THEORIES OF CONSTITUTIONAL FAMILY LAWEach of the opinions in Obergefell demonstrates a particu-lar judicial theory of constitutional family law. Understandingthese theories-and especially, the differences between them-will help us to read Obergefell in light of Dir.A. Marriage as an Exercise of CitizenshipJustice Kennedy has long been the \"swing vote\" on theSupreme Court in many categories of controversial constitu-tional cases.7 7 In the areas of family constitutional rights, gen-der discrimination, and sexual orientation discrimination, hisdecisive role has been particularly noticeable.7876 Richard Lazarus has argued that Din was likely originally assigned to Jus-tice Kennedy \"after fragmented voting at conference with the expectation that hewas best positioned to produce an opinion of the Court, but he was subsequentlyunable to secure the necessary majority for his draft opinion.\" Richard J.

Texas, for example, the ques-tion before the Court was whether Texas's Homosexual Con-duct Law, which allowed the state to criminally convict thepetitioners for consensual, private sexual activity, violated thepetitioners' constitutional rights.8 5 But Justice Kennedy's rea-soning in striking down the statute characterized the petition-ers' sexual encounter as valuable not for itself but because itmight lead to a longer-term relationship. \"When sexuality findsovert expression in intimate conduct with another person,\"Justice Kennedy wrote, \"the conduct can be but one element ina personal bond that is more enduring\"-perhaps an \"endur-ing\" personal bond such as marriage?8 6 In fact, in Lawrence,Justice Kennedy expressly repudiated the idea that sex alone isworthy of protection. In overruling Bowers v.

It is the context in which it occurs-a committedrelationship, or even the potential for a committed relation-ship-in which it becomes worthy of protection.8 9 Lawrenceprovides an early hint of Kennedy's linkage of marriage to re-sponsible citizenship in ObergefelLThis linkage is also evident in Justice Kennedy's attentionin Windsor to marriage as the preferred social and legal spacefor the raising of children. In Windsor, Justice Kennedy's ma-jority opinion critiqued the Defense of Marriage Act because it\"humiliates tens of thousands of children now being raised bysame-sex couples. The law in question makes it even moredifficult for the children to understand the integrity and close-ness of their own family and its concord with other families intheir community and in their daily lives.\"9 0 Just as in Law-rence, where Justice Kennedy transformed a case about casualsex into one about a potential long-term relationship, in Wind-sor, he took a case about two women who never had childrenand reached a holding based, in part, on the imagined effect ofDOMA on \"tens of thousands\" of children.9 1 As ProfessorDeborah Widiss has observed, \"[niotably absent from theCourt's analysis was any recognition that in any given class-room, there would likely be many children who have unmar-ried, different-sex parents.\"9 2Justice Kennedy's concern for same-sex couples' access toboth the burdens and obligations of marriage and his concernfor the stability of children's family relationships are under-scored by an implicit theory regarding marriage's role in theexercise of responsible citizenship. His Windsor opinion dis-cusses at length the historical tradition of state, not federal88 Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 567.89 See Adler, supra note 83, at 18-19.90 United States v. Windsor, 133 S.

She also notes that this argument is\"deeply in tension with efforts made a generation ago to lessen the importance-both symbolic and substantive-of whether a child was born to a legal marriage.\"ICL2018]1 523CORNELL LAW REVIEWlaw, governing marriage. Because his discussion occurs in thecontext of a dispute over federalism principles-can federal lawoverride state marriage law?-it is easy to overlook the extentto which Justice Kennedy understands marriage as an exerciseof citizenship. The community of which one is a member, forpurposes of Windsor, is the state, not the nation, but citizen-ship is nevertheless the operating principle. Consider, for ex-ample, Justice Kennedy's characterization of New York'sdecision to recognize Ms. Windsor's marriage:Here the State's decision to give this class of persons the rightto marry conferred upon them a dignity and status of im-mense import. When the State used its historic and essentialauthority to define the marital relation in this way, its roleand its power in making the decision enhanced the recogni-tion, dignity, and protection of the class in their owncommun ity.9 3For Justice Kennedy, marriage is not only the most privilegedform of adult relationship, it is also the means by which statesconfer legal protection and status on their citizens.Justice Kennedy's Obergefell opinion builds on the rhetoricbegun in Lawrence and Windsor, making marriage the pre-ferred social and legal space for sexual intimacy and childrear-ing. It starts from the principle established in Loving, Zablocki,and Turmer that marriage is a fundamental right.9 4 Much of theopinion is then devoted to explaining the principles underlyingthe right and how those principles and traditions apply tosame-sex couples.9 5The first principle or tradition set forth in Kennedy's opin-ion is one of choice and self-definition: \"[Plersonal choice re-garding marriage is inherent in the concept of individualautonomy.\"96 Justice Kennedy compares choice in marriage toother \"intimate\" choices, such as \"choices concerning contra-ception, family relationships, procreation, and childrearing.\" 97He then cites the language from Zablocki that sets marriageapart as the preferred family form: \"Indeed, the Court hasnoted it would be contradictory 'to recognize a right of privacywith respect to other matters of family life and not with respectto the decision to enter the relationship that is the foundation93 Windsor, 133 S. Ct. at 2692 (emphasis added).94 135 S.

Histor-ically, marriage was less about self-definition than it was aboutsurvival and the creation of alliances between families for self-preservation and the consolidation of private property. 1 0 2 JUS-tice Kennedy's version, in which marriage can help to facilitatea person's \"expression, intimacy, and spirituality\" 0 3 is highlyindividualistic, focused on the personal needs of the two par-ties to the marriage and not on the well-being of the extendedfamily or community. Yet his opinion simultaneously revivesthe strand of Zablocki's thinking in which marriage is the ap-proved, proper space for intimate and reproductive activities,superior to other, lesser relationship statuses. His opinion isliberal, rather than communitarian, yet he still understandsmarriage as a disciplinary institution.Justice Kennedy's second principle is one of companion-ship: \"[The right to marry is fundamental because it supports atwo-person union unlike any other in its importance to thecommitted individuals.\"' 0 4 It is in discussing this principle98 Id.

It offers the hope of companionship andunderstanding and assurance that while both still live therewill be someone to care for the other.\"105 This claim stands instark contrast to his opinion in Din, as we shall see.Justice Kennedy's third principle is that marriage is pro-tected because it is good for children. Marriage \"safeguardschildren and families and thus draws meaning from relatedrights of childrearing, procreation, and education.\" 106 Thisclaim hinges on two premises: that marital children have morelegal and financial security than nonmarital children (which isoften true) and that nonmarital children are emotionallyharmed because their family form is not as good as a maritalfamily. \"Without the recognition, stability, and predictabilitymarriage offers,\" the opinion explains, \"[same-sex couples']children suffer the stigma of knowing their families are some-how lesser. They also suffer the significant material costs ofbeing raised by unmarried parents, relegated through no faultof their own to a more difficult and uncertain family life.\"1 0 7This claim, which echoes the claim in Kennedy's majority opin-ion in Windsor that nonrecognition of same-sex marriage \"hu-miliates\" the children of those couples, '0 has generatedextensive criticism that the opinion has the potential to rollback the rights of nonmarital children.109105 Id. at 2600.

Hill (\"the foundation of the family and of society,without which there would be neither civilization nor pro-gress\")11s and Alexis de Tocqueville:There is certainly no country in the world where the tie ofmarriage is so much respected as in America ...

Marriage as a Natural RightUnlike Justice Kennedy, the Justices who dissented inObergefell were unwilling to read either due process or equalprotection expansively enough to include same-sex marriage.Obergefell resulted in a somewhat unusual outcome: a majorityopinion joined by four Justices who likely did not agree withthe analysis, and four separate dissents by justices who werelargely in agreement with one another. Each of the opinionslaments the majority's overreaching' 17 and lack of doctrinalrigor.1 18 Each, however, has distinguishing characteristics,that, read with other constitutional family cases and with Dinin particular, illuminate some important differences in the Jus-tices' conceptions of marriage.1. Justice ScaliaBecause he cast such a long shadow over constitutionaljurisprudence during his many years of service and was sovocal in a few particular constitutional family cases, it is sensi-ble to begin our analysis with Justice Scalia.Where Justice Kennedy understands family rights as im-portant because of the social cohesion they provide, JusticeScalia understood family rights as natural rights that were pre-constitutional or extra-constitutional-extremely important,but important for legislatures, not courts, to recognize and sus-tain. The Justice's aversion to constitutional family rights fliesbelow the radar in some of his opinions. Many constitutionalfamily cases were decided long before Justice Scalia joined theCourt, and he sometimes felt bound to existing case law underprinciples of stare decisis. In these cases, however, he oftensimply joined the opinion of another Justice, or wrote narrowly117 See Obergefell, 135 S. Ct. at 2611 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting) (\"[Tihis Courtis not a legislature.. . . [Flor those who believe in a government of laws, not ofmen, the majority's approach is deeply disheartening.\"); id. at 2627 (Scalia, J.,dissenting) (\"Today's decree says that my Ruler, and the Ruler of 320 millionAmericans coast-to-coast, is a majority of the nine lawyers on the SupremeCourt. . . . This practice of constitutional revision by an unelected committee ofnine, always accompanied (as it is today) by extravagant praise of liberty, robs thePeople of the most important liberty they asserted in the Declaration of Indepen-dence and won in the Revolution of 1776: the freedom to govern themselves\"); id.at 2631 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (\"By straying from the text of the Constitution,substantive due process exalts judges at the expense of the People from whomthey derive their authority.\")118 See id. at 2612 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting) (\"The majority's decision is an actof will, not legal judgment.\"); id. at 2630 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (\"The stuff con-tained in today's opinion has to diminish this Court's reputation for clear thinkingand sober analysis.\").528 [Vol. 103:501THE RIGHTS OF MARRIAGEto make a particular point, making it clear that, had he to do itover again, the Court never would have started down the sub-stantive due process path.Consider, for example, his treatment of the two chestnutsof constitutional parental rights from the 1920s-Meyer v. Ne-braska and Pierce v. Society of Sisters.\" 9 In each of thesecases, the Court held that parents had an interest under theDue Process Clause in the care, custody, and control of theirchildren-in the case of Meyer, to decide that their childrenwould learn German, 1 2 0 and in Pierce, to decide that their chil-dren would attend private religious school.121 These cases,despite their Lochner-era taint, are well-established and havebeen relied on in dozens of Supreme Court and thousands oflower court opinions. But in Troxel v. Granville, in which theCourt struck down a Washington State statute that allowedgrandparents liberal rights to petition family courts for visita-tion with their grandchildren, Justice Scalia dissented.1 2 2 Inso doing, he came as close as he could to repudiating Meyerand Pierce without advocating for their overruling. Troxel failedto produce a majority, with six of the nine Justices publishing aplurality, concurrence, or dissent. This \"sheer diversity\" ofopinion, Justice Scalia opined,persuades me that the theory of unenumerated parentalrights underlying [the previous] cases has small claim tostare decisis protection. A legal principle that can be thoughtto produce such diverse outcomes in the relatively simplecase before us here is not a legal principle that has inducedsubstantial reliance. While I would not now overrule thoseearlier cases (that has not been urged), neither would I ex-tend the theory upon which they rested to this newcontext.1 2 3In other words, parents may retain the right to care, custody,and control of their children in the very narrow, fact-specific,educational contexts set forth in Meyer and Pierce, but theserights should not be extended by the Court to other contexts,such as visitation or child custody.1 2 4119 Pierce v. Soc'y of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510 (1925); Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S.390 (1923).120 See 262 U.S. at 400.121 See 268 U.S. at 532-35.122 530 U.S. 57, 91 (2000) (Scalia, J. dissenting).123 Id. at 92 (Scalia, J., dissenting).124 Although he did not say so in Troxel, Justice Scalia's opinion in Employ-ment Division v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990) suggests an additional method ofdistinguishing previous constitutional family cases from contemporary ones. InSmith, Justice Scalia distinguished the case at hand-which asked whether Na-2018] 529CORNELL LAW REVIEWJustice Scalia's skepticism of family constitutional rightswas not confined to parental rights. In 1987, the year after hejoined the Court, he quietly joined Justice O'Connor's majorityopinion in Turner v. Safley, striking down prison regulationsthat denied prisoners the right to marry.1 2 5 But in his numer-ous dissents in the more recent cases, he avoided any state-ment affirming marriage as a fundamental right. In Lawrencev. Texas, for example, he attempted to refute the analogy be-tween same-sex marriage bans and antimiscegenation law byrecasting Loving v. Virginia as a case that applied strict scru-tiny solely because race was at issue.1 2 6 Loving did use thislogic, but it also, independently, struck down the statute inquestion using a substantive due process rationale based onthe right to marry-a fact ignored by Justice Scalia in Law-rence. And in United States v. Windsor, Justice Scalia declinedentirely in his dissent to discuss the line of right-to-marrycases, noting only in passing that the idea that same-sex mar-riage is \"deeply rooted in history and tradition . . . would ofcourse be quite absurd.\"l 27 The Justice's hostility to the con-stitutionalization of LGBTQ rights is clear from passages suchas this one. But more surprising and interesting is his whole-sale hostility to the recognition of family constitutional rights-for anyone, including heterosexual married couples and mar-ried parents.It is not that Justice Scalia did not approve of such fami-lies. Indeed, references in many cases not only disparaged gayand lesbian families but also treated the marital family as su-perior to the genetic.1 2 8 Rather, he did not believe that thetive Americans had a right to ingest peyote as part of a religious ritual-fromWisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 207 (1972), a case that had exempted Amishparents from sending their children to public school past the eighth grade. InSmith, Scalia argued that because the parents in Yoder were asserting a \"hybrid\"right-a combination of free exercise of religion and a liberty interest in theirchildren-the claim there was stronger than the pure free exercise claim in Smith.Smith, 494 U.S. at 881-82. Thus, Justice Scalia used a rights doctrine he disfa-vored in some contexts (substantive due process) as a sword to help to circum-scribe another rights doctrine (free exercise).125 482 U.S. 78, 81 (1987).126 539 U.S. 558, 600 (2003) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (\"In Loving, however, wecorrectly applied heightened scrutiny, rather than the usual rational-basis review,because the Virginia statute was 'designed to maintain White Supremacy.'\" (quot-ing Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 6 (1967))).127 133 S. Ct. 2675, 2707 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted).128 Consider, for example, Scalia's differential treatment in parentage disputeof the child's genetic mother's husband versus the child's genetic father in MichaelH. v. Gerald D., 491 U.S. 110 (1989). The law, Scalia argued, must choose onefather or the other, and \"[olne of them will pay a price for asserting that 'free-dom'-Michael by being unable to act as father of the child he has adulterously[Vol. 103:501530THE RIGHTS OF MARRIAGEConstitution was the appropriate place to seek legal protectionof the family. His extensive Troxel dissent offers the most re-vealing glimpse into his ideas about the family and the Consti-tution, and, although it deals with parental rights, likelyrepresented his views on marriage rights as well. \"In my view,\"he explained, \"a right of parents to direct the upbringing oftheir children is among the 'unalienable Rights' with which theDeclaration of Independence proclaims 'all men . . . are en-dowed by their Creator.'\"1 29 These rights, then, are very impor-tant, and would have been understood as such by the men whoestablished our form of government. The Declaration of Inde-pendence was not the only place where Justice Scalia foundevidence of the importance of family rights: \"in my view thatright is also among the othe[r] [rights] retained by the peoplewhich the Ninth Amendment says the Constitution's enumera-tion of rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage.\" 3 0For Justice Scalia, however, evidence that the founders consid-ered these rights important is emphatically not evidence thatthey provided a constitutional mechanism for their protection:The Declaration of Independence, however, is not a legal pre-scription conferring powers upon the courts; and the Consti-tution's refusal to \"deny or disparage\" other rights is farremoved from affirming any one of them, and even furtherremoved from authorizing judges to identify what they mightbe, and to enforce the judges' list against laws duly enactedby the people. Consequently, while I would think it entirelycompatible with the commitment to representative democ-racy set forth in the founding documents to argue, in legisla-tive chambers or in electoral campaigns, that the State hasno power to interfere with parents' authority over the rearingof their children, I do not believe that the power which theConstitution confers upon me as ajudge entitles me to denylegal effect to laws that (in my view) infringe upon what is (inmy view) that unenumerated right. 131Dean David Meyer has described Scalia's treatment of theNinth Amendment in this passage as \"a sort of constitutionalblack hole, a gateway into a vacuum of nonlegal, unenforceablerights.\"l 32 The Justice would likely have countered this accu-begotten, or Gerald by being unable to preserve the integrity of the traditionalfamily unit he and Victoria have established.\" Id. at 130.129 Troxel v.

This position, Meyer notes, puts Scalia20 181] 53 1CORNELL LAW REVIEWsation in two ways: first, by arguing that these rights are sodeeply rooted that the people would be unlikely to vote toabridge them (by, for example, voting to abolish marriage alto-gether) and second, by pointing to equal protection as a poten-tial alternative mechanism for assuring equity. Consider againJustice Scalia's recasting of Loving v. Virginia as a case solelyabout race. Since the Equal Protection Clause prohibits theuse of race to discriminate against individuals, the logic wouldgo, discrimination in marriage based on race is impermissible,and there is no need to resort to an analysis of whether theright to marry is \"fundamental\" or not. 133Occasionally, Justice Scalia's constitutional family lawopinions were surprising. In 2013, for example, he dissentedin Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl, a case in which the majorityopinion, written by Justice Alito, construed the Indian ChildWelfare Act to allow termination of parental rights where thegenetic parent never had custody of the child.13 4 Justice Scaliadisagreed with Justice Alito's parsing of the statute, but alsochose in his dissent to comment on the case:The Court's opinion, it seems to me, needlessly demeans therights of parenthood. It has been the constant practice of thecommon law to respect the entitlement of those who bring achild into the world to raise that child. We do not inquirewhether leaving a child with his parents is 'in the best inter-est of the child.' It sometimes is not; he would be better offraised by someone else. But parents have their rights, noless than children do. This father wants to raise his daugh-ter, and the statute amply protects his right to do so. There isno reason in law or policy to dilute that protection. 3 5This statement, of course, is not a constitutional one.Here, Justice Scalia referred to the common law, and his opin-ions references \"rights\" under the common law, not the Four-teenth Amendment. Without understanding this context, thestrong defense of the parent-child relationship comes as a sur-prise given his position in constitutional family cases.in \"diametric opposition\" to that taken by Justice Thomas, who would have giventhe mother in Troxel the maximum protection offered by strict scrutiny to protecther fundamental right to care, custody, and control of her child. Meyer, supranote 13, at 552 n.135 (2008).133 See also Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 980 n.1 (1992)(Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment in part, dissenting in part) (arguing thatthere was no need to inquire into whether a ban on interracial marriages wassupported by \"tradition\" because it violated the text of the Equal ProtectionClause).134 133 S. Ct. 2552, 2557 (2013).135 Id. at 2572 (Scalia, J., dissenting).532 [Vol. 103:501THE RIGHTS OF MARRIAGEThere is an \"on/off\" quality to Justice Scalia's characteriza-tion of fundamental rights not always shared by the other Jus-tices. For Scalia, the bogeyman of constitutional law was theidea that once something has been declared a \"fundamentalright\" it takes on a tremendously powerful status, and cantrump even very important state interests.13 6 It is this fear thatappears to animate his hostility toward procedural due processclaims. In Michael H. v. Gerald D., for example, he recast aprocedural claim as a substantive one, and once it was sub-stantive, it was easy to conclude that the petitioner had nosuch right.' 3 7 Procedural claims are more incremental, andmore contestable in specific cases. If a court recognizes aclaim, for example, that someone has a \"constitutional libertyinterest\" in marriage or parenting, it does not necessarily followthat the interest is absolute.' 3 8 Many of the other Troxel con-currences and dissents understood this well, arguing that aparent's liberty interest needed to be balanced with other inter-ests, such as the interests of the child. 1 UnderstandingScalia's extreme hostility requires understanding that for him,the stakes seemed very high indeed.Justice Scalia's attitude toward constitutional marriagerights in Obergefell is not particularly surprising given the posi-tions he took in other constitutional family law cases.1 4 0 Hisconsistent position in all of these cases has been that theresimply is no constitutional right to the protection of the fam-ily-despite the family's important traditional role in Americansociety. 141 Thus, his position in Obergefell is not simply thatLGBTQ people have no right to marry-although he wouldagree with that statement-but rather that there is no constitu-tional right to marry-for anyone, gay or straight.1 42136 See Obergefell v. Hodges, 135 S. Ct. 2584, 2621-22 (2015) (Scalia, J.,dissenting) (questioning the reasoning of the majority opinion by asking why thesame logic would not authorize marriage of more than two people).137 491 U.S. 110, 116-27 (1989).138 See, e.g., Turner v.

The opinion reaches new levels ofsarcasm even for the Justice most known for taking a derisivetone in his opinions.1 43 For example, in response to the major-ity's claim that \"[tihe nature of marriage is that, through itsenduring bond, two persons together can find other freedoms,such as expression, intimacy, and spirituality,\" the Justice re-marked, \"Really? Who ever thought that intimacy and spiritu-ality [whatever that means] were freedoms? And if intimacy is,one would think Freedom of Intimacy is abridged rather thanexpanded by marriage. Ask the nearest hippie. Expression,sure enough, is a freedom, but anyone in a long-lasting mar-riage will attest that that happy state constricts, rather thanexpands, what one can prudently say.\"1 44Many others have commented on the extraordinary \"vitriol\"employed by Justice Scalia in ObergefelL 14 5 What has some-times been lost in these analyses is that the target of his vitriolis not LGBTQ people-although, as the people whose rights areat issue in the case, it would be difficult not to take the rancorpersonally-but the recognition of family constitutional rightsper se, and the particular, seemingly unmoored, legal con-struction of these rights by Justice Kennedy. Justice Scaliaprobably really would have wanted to \"hide his head in abag\"14 6 for joining such an opinion, because his view of theConstitution is that it addresses only a very narrow class of143 See Louis Michael Seidman, The Triumph of Gay Marriage and the Failureof Constitutional Law, 2015 Sup.

Justice ThomasSimilarly, Justice Thomas adopts an originalist methodol-ogy in his Obergefell dissent, one that does not disparage mar-riage but instead the idea that family rights are constitutionalrights. Justice Thomas's dissent focuses more specifically onthe notion of \"liberty\" as it is used in the Fourteenth Amend-ment. For Justice Thomas, the \"liberty\" referred to in the DueProcess Clause is the same \"liberty\" protected by Magna Carta,a \"liberty from physical restraint.\"147 Even if, Justice Thomasthen argues, the framers might have recognized a \"naturalright\" to marriage that fell within their concept of \"liberty,\" thisright \"would not have included a right to governmental recogni-tion and benefits.\"14 8 All this right would have entailed wouldbe the private right to engage in activity unencumbered by thestate: \"making vows, holding religious ceremonies celebratingthose vows, raising children, and otherwise enjoying the societyof one's spouse .... At the founding, such conduct was under-stood to predate government, not to flow from it.\"149Justice Thomas's libertarian view of marriage understandsit as a negative right, not a positive one. 1 5 0 For JusticeThomas, Jim Obergefell and the other plaintiffs had not beendenied their right to liberty because \"they have been able tocohabitate and raise their children in peace . . [and t]hey havebeen able to travel freely around the country, making theirhomes where they please.\" 15 1 He notes:[The petitioners] do not ask this Court to order the States tostop restricting their ability to enter same-sex relationships,to engage in intimate behavior, to make vows to their part-ners in public ceremonies, to engage in religious weddingceremonies, to hold themselves out as married, or to raise147 Id. at 2633 (Thomas, J., dissenting).148 Id. at 2636.149 Id.150 For a contrasting view, see Strauss, supra note 9, at 1694 (arguing thatmarriage is an example of a \"power right\"-a right to create legal duties).151 135 S. Ct. at 2635. Justice Thomas's opinion here seems to conflict withhis dissent in Lawrence v. Texas, in which he observed that \"punishing someonefor expressing his sexual preference through noncommercial consensual conductwith another adult does not appear to be a worthy way to expend valuable lawenforcement resources\" but declined to find the law an infringement on the plain-tiffs' liberty. 539 U.S. 558, 605 (2003) (Thomas, J., dissenting).2018] 535CORNELL LAW REVIEWchildren.... Instead, the States have refused to grant themgovernmental entitlements.1 5 2Professor Louis Michael Seidman, writing in the wake ofObergefel, noted that this position is typical for JusticeThomas and,If adopted... would lead to wholesale overruling of scores ofcases extending over almost a century, on subjects rangingfrom incorporation of Bill of Rights protections against thestates, to procedural due process cases, to decisions protect-ing against government prohibitions on contraception, abor-tion, private schooling, and family living arrangements.1 5 3Despite its radical departure from the Court's constitutionaldoctrine, Thomas's dissent is notable for its understanding ofmarriage as a pre-constitutional, natural right-very similar tothe \"right to parent\" articulated by Justice Scalia in TroxeL\"Petitioners misunderstand the institution of marriage whenthey say that it would 'mean little' absent governmental recog-nition\"; 15 4 for Thomas, marriage is outside government recogni-tion entirely.3. Chief Justice RobertsAlthough Chief Justice Roberts wrote the lengthiest of theObergefeU dissents, his is the least interesting for our pur-poses. The Chief Justice carries the water for the dissentingteam by setting forth in great detail the constitutional view thatsubstantive due process is dangerous, with the usual analysisof Dred Scott and Lochner.15 5 He also spends several pageslamenting the Court's intrusion into what he views as a funda-mentally political decision. 5 6 There is one moment, however,in the opinion that seems anomalous. In his critique of themajority's equal protection analysis, he notes that the claimsbrought by petitioners in the case \"target the laws definingmarriage generally rather than those allocating benefits specifi-cally.\"' 57 He then goes on to say that \"the equal protectionanalysis might be different, in my view, if we were confrontedwith a more focused challenge to the denial of certain tangiblebenefits,\" or, perhaps, to a particular class of noncitizens de-nied admission. 5 s This sentence suggests that the Chief Jus-152 Obergefell, 135 S.

Justice AlitoProfessor Neil Siegel has argued that Justice Alito's ap-proach to constitutional cases is that of a \"traditional conserva-tive\": unlike Justices Scalia and Thomas, who are bothoriginalists, Justice Alito's methodology varies from case tocase, but his conclusions support traditionally conservativeends. 16 1 In Professor Siegel's words, \"in light of Justice Scalia'spassing, Justice Alito has become the primary judicial voice ofthe many millions of Americans who appear to be losing theculture wars, including in battles over gay rights, women's ac-cess to reproductive healthcare, affirmative action, and relig-ious exemptions.\"1 6 2 Justice Alito's privileging of conservativevalues stands in sharp contrast to Justice Scalia, a conserva-tive who nonetheless sometimes wrote or joined opinions with\"liberal\" outcomes due to his originalist methodology. 163Indeed, Justice Alito's Obergefell dissent follows this trajec-tory. Justice Alito reiterates the dominant rationale used bystates in defending same-sex marriage bans throughout muchof the early 2000s-that the purpose of marriage is to supportresponsible procreation by heterosexual couples. 164 For themajority, Justice Alito notes, the purpose of marriage is that it\"provides emotional fulfillment and the promise of support in159 See Ronny Hamed-Troyansky, Erasing \"Gay\" From the Blackboard: TheUnconstitutionality of \"No Promo Homo\" Education Laws, 20 U.C.

But once you show me the original thinking, I am hand-cuffed. I cannot do the nasty conservative things I would like to do to thecountry.\").164 See Abrams & Brooks, supra note 102 (discussing history of \"accidentalprocreation\" argument in same-sex marriage litigation).2 0181] 537CORNELL LAW REVIEWtimes of need.\"165 He then observes that the governmental in-terest in Kennedy's view of marriage is that \"by benefiting per-sons who choose to wed, marriage indirectly benefits societybecause persons who live in stable, fulfilling, and supportiverelationships make better citizens.\"l 66 He then contrasts hisown view that marriage is not about \"the happiness of personswho choose to marry\" but instead was \"[flor millennia . . .inextricably linked to the one thing that only an opposite-sexcouple can do: procreate.\"1 6 7 There are, he argues, \"reasonablesecular grounds for restricting marriage to opposite-sexcouples,\" because only they need legal encouragement to en-gage in \"potentially procreative conduct . . . within a lastingunit that has long been thought to provide the best atmospherefor raising children.\"16 8The dissent's last section also melds together two familiarconservative arguments-first, the argument that theObergefell majority is usurping authority from the politicalbranches, and second, that the opinion itself will cause harm toAmericans with traditional values. The opinion, Justice Alitowarns,[WIill be used to vilify Americans who are unwilling to assentto the new orthodoxy. . . . I assume that those who cling tothe old beliefs will be able to whisper their thoughts in therecesses of their homes, but if they repeat these views inpublic, they will risk being labeled as bigots and treated assuch by governments, employers, and schools.' 69Perhaps the most important aspect of Justice Alito's opin-ion for future cases is that he does not repudiate the line ofcases that articulate the right to marry (Loving, Zablocki, Tur-ner) and right of families to live together (Moore). In fact, he isthe only one of the dissenters to not join Chief Justice Robert'sdissent, with its long, cautionary history of Lochner and itsprogeny.17 0 It appears that Justice Alito does believe in a con-stitutional right to marry, and perhaps not simply based onstare decisis grounds. He simply does not believe that the rightprotects what the majority thinks it does-the right to personalfulfillment and the exercise of citizenship. Instead, for JusticeAlito, the right to marry is the right to engage in an institution165 Obergefell, 135 S.

Distinguishing the DissentersWith the four dissenting Justices in Obergefell, then, wesee four different articulations of a natural, pre-constitutionalright to marry. Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas both viewthis right as both pre- and extra- constitutional; not only didthe right predate the Constitution, but it also was never incor-porated into the Constitution. The main difference between thetwo seems to lie in whether there is a negative right to marry.Justice Scalia would leave this issue completely to the demo-cratic process; Justice Thomas intimates that some depriva-tions of liberty might create cognizable constitutional harm.Each of them, given the opportunity, would happily overturnmany constitutional precedents (Justice Thomas, perhaps, allof them). Chief Justice Roberts, in contrast, would find such amove destabilizing, but is very cautious about further balloon-ing substantive due process rights beyond what he views asalready dangerously extended. Justice Alto stands alone as adissenter who really does dissent against same-sex marriageitself, rather than the constitutional method used by the major-ity. His notion of marriage as a \"fundamental\" right does notmean that it exists outside the Constitution.1 7 2 Rather, the\"fundamental\" for Justice Alito can be enshrined in the Consti-tution, 173 because it reflects the truth of human experience.This distinction between Justice Alito and other Obergefell dis-senters becomes clearer, as we shall see, when read alongsideDin.IIIDIN's THEORIES OF CONSTITUTIONAL FAMILY LAWRead alone, Obergefell appears to create a sharp contrastbetween five Justices who believe that the right of same-sexcouples to marry can be comfortably lodged in substantive dueprocess, equal protection, or both, and four sharply dissentingJustices who object to the extension of the law. But as we have171 For the classic exposition of family law's \"channeling function,\" see Carl E.Schneider, The Channeling Function in Family Law, 20 HOFSTRA L. REv. 495, 498(1992) (arguing that \"in the channeling function the law creates or (more often)supports social institutions which are thought to serve desirable ends\").172 Obergefell, 135 S. Ct. at 2641 (Alito, J., dissenting)173 Id.2018] 539CORNELL LAW REVIEWseen, the dissenting opinions are more nuanced than that cari-cature, and differ from each other in important ways. Too,most scholars are skeptical that the four Justices who joinedJustice Kennedy's opinion were entirely comfortable with itsanalysis.17 4 Nevertheless, Obergefell is fairly easy to read in away that creates sharp divisions between two sets of politicallyand methodologically divided Justices.Read alongside Din, however, the Obergefell opinions takeon a different cast. The extreme originalist views of JusticesScalia and Thomas are more sharply foregrounded. JusticeScalia's plurality opinion in Din, joined by Chief Justice Rob-erts and Justice Alito, uses history selectively to paint a pictureof the past that, while technically accurate, misses the largerpicture.' 7 5 This plurality, read with Obergefel, highlights theways in which originalist methodology can be used to undercuteven rights that were firmly established at the founding. Jus-tice Kennedy's Din concurrence appears at face value to contra-dict much of his soaring rhetoric in Obergefell but readingObergefell with close attention to Justice Kennedy's emphasison citizenship helps to reconcile the cases. Justice Alito's deci-sion to join Justice Kennedy's Din concurrence makes sense,given his non-originalist dissent in Obergefell, and provides aclue as to what he might do in future cases. Finally, JusticeBreyer's Din dissent, joined by Justices Ginsburg, Kagan, andSotomayor, offers a justification for constitutional protection ofmarriage that stands in stark contrast to Obergefel's paean tothe institution.' 7 6 The dissent may tell us more about what atleast one of the Justices who remained silent in Obergefellthinks about marriage rights and LGBTQ rights more broadlythan the Obergefell majority itself.A. Marriage as a Natural Right in DinKerry v. Din begins with a plurality opinion written by Jus-tice Scalia and joined by Justice Thomas and Chief JusticeRoberts. 1\" So far, we have established that Justice Scalia'sstance toward constitutional family rights was that under aproper reading of the Constitution, they did not exist, but thatthe Court had (unfortunately) recognized them in the past, and174 See, e.g., Robson, supra note 75, passitm (arguing that if Justice Ginsburghad instead wrote the Obergefell opinion the holding would have been grounded inthe Equal Protection Clause, rather than the Due Process Clause, and would havebeen less sentimental and more doctrinally rigorous).175 Kerry v.

Ct. 2128, 2131 (2015).176 Id. at 2142 (Breyer, J., dissenting).177 Id. at 2131 (opinion of Scalia, J.).540 [Vol. 103:501THE RIGHTS OF MARRIAGEthe Court should go no further.17 8 These arguments took fullbloom in the late Justice's plurality opinion in Din.Recall that Din put the question before the Court ofwhether Fauzia Din had a procedural due process interest inher marriage to Kanishka Berashk such that she was entitledto an explanation for his visa denial. Justice Scalia understoodthis claim more expansively than she articulated it-in linewith his usual impulse to understand due process claims asclaims about \"fundamental rights\" that can trump importantstate interests rather than as narrower questions of proceduraljustice. For Scalia, Din's claim was that the denial of her hus-band's visa was a \"depriv[ation] ... of her constitutional rightto live in the United States with her spouse.\"' 7 9Justice Scalia's opinion then followed the logic one wouldexpect based on his prior opinions and those he joined. Just asJustice Thomas would ground \"liberty\" in Magna Carta tendays later in his Obergefell dissent, 's 0 Justice Scalia here ar-gued that neither Din nor Berashk had experienced a \"depriva-tion of liberty\" as understood by Magna Carta or the treatisewriters read by the founders, which would have required physi-cal restraint (\"keeping [her] against h[er] will in a private house,putting h[er] in the stocks, arresting or forcibly detaining h[er]in the street\").' 8 ' Of course, the Court has recognized libertyinterests in the family context that go far beyond physical re-straint, and so the opinion focused on demonstrating why theparticular claims made by Din were beyond the scope of therights already articulated by the Court in previous constitu-tional family cases.18 2 In making this case, the Justice againtook swipes at Meyer and Pierce without expressly calling fortheir overrule (\"[d]espite this historical evidence, this Court hasseen fit on several occasions to expand the meaning of 'liberty'under the Due Process Clause\"; \"I think it worth explainingwhy, even if one accepts the textually unsupportable doctrineof implied fundamental rights, Din's arguments would fail\"). '8 3In order for Din's claim to be recognized as a constitutionalright, for Justice Scalia, she would need to show that the rightshe had articulated was \"deeply rooted in [the] Nation's history178 See d at 2131.179 Id.180 Obergefell v.

I am probably in a bet-ter position than many to notice this, as the Justice relied inpart on my publications to create his alternative history. 187Carefully choosing one of the most xenophobic moments inAmerican history as his example, Justice Scalia observed thatin the 1920s, when Congress first imposed national originsquotas, there were often not enough spots to accommodate allof the immigrants who wished to join their spouses in theUnited States. 188 In focusing on this narrow, three-year win-dow, he quickly brushed aside decades during which immigra-tion was not regulated at all (\"[a]lthough immnigration waseffectively unregulated prior to 1875\") and ignored the copioushistorical evidence that even after Congress attempted to limitspousal immigration, courts often ignored these prescriptions,finding ways to construe statutes to protect the marital rela-tionship,1 89 as well as the evidence that exceptions to the gen-184 Id.185 Id. at 2135.186 Id. at 2133.187 Id. at 2136 (citing Kerry Abrams, What Makes the Family Special?, 80 U.CHI.

Citing to the Expa-triation Act of 1907, which provided that \"any Americanwoman who marries a foreigner shall take the nationality of herhusband,\" 19 1 the Justice argued that \"a woman in Din's posi-tion not only lacked a liberty interest that might be affected bythe Government's disposition of her husband's visa applica-tion, she lost her own rights as a citizen upon marriage.\"1 92 Inother words, because marriage was an institution that madegender-based distinctions and protected the relationship rightsof men but not women, there is no general \"deeply rooted\"practice of protection for the marital relationship.

Justice Scalia could have found, using the same his-torical record he mined to support his argument, that familyreunification has long been considered a fundamental right,\"deeply rooted in history and tradition.\" There was far moreevidence in favor of this proposition than against it. He thencould have found that, in the 1970s, the Court began to recog-nize gender discrimination as covered by the FourteenthAmendment, and that principles of stare decisis require theCourt to continue to recognize it as such.19 4 He then couldhave concluded that the fundamental right to family reunifica-tion had to be applied in a gender-neutral way.Like his opinion in Obergefell, however, the Din plurality isconsistent with Justice Scalia's understanding of marriage andfamily rights as pre-constitutional, extra-constitutional, natu-ral rights. Equal protection is of no help under his theory,because equality is a one-way ratchet, used to justify the cur-tailing of what was once understood as a right of husbands andfathers rather than the extension of that right to all. As manyother scholars have previously noted, there are many unfortu-nate practices in our nation's history that are \"deeplyrooted.\"19 5193 Id. at 2136.194 In other cases, the Justice was skeptical that gender discrimination shouldreceive intermediate scrutiny at all, and appears to have applied the rule solelyout of deference to precedent, but he did nevertheless advocate applying the rule.See, e.g., United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 568 (1996) (Scalia, J., dissent-ing) (remarking that \"[w]e have no established criterion for 'intermediate scrutiny'either, but essentially apply it when it seems like a good idea to load the dice\"); id.at 570 (\"To reject the Court's disposition today, however, it is not necessary toaccept my view that the Court's made-up tests cannot displace longstandingnational traditions as the primary determinant of what the Constitution means.

In addition, the opinion is consistentwith Chief Justice Roberts's Obergefell dissent in its reluctanceto enunciate \"new\" fundamental rights under substantive dueprocess. The decision to join the plurality in Din highlights justhow leery of substantive due process the Chief Justice is. Hisadmonitions in Obergefell that, regardless of one's personalstance on LGBTQ rights, the expansion of doctrine in the Ken-nedy majority is disturbing, seem even more sincere read inlight of Dirt He would consistently refuse to expand the rightsthe Court has recognized under substantive due process to avariety of cases, involving many different categories of people,not just gays and lesbians.B. Marriage as an Exercise of Citizenship in DinLet us turn now to Justice Kennedy's concurrence in Din,joined only by Justice Alito. The contrast between Justice Ken-nedy's Obergefell majority opinion and his concurrence in Dinis arguably the most incongruous in all of these opinions. TheJustice Kennedy of Obergefell is broadly protective of thecouple's desire to marry, to choose whom to marry, to be withthat person of choice, to protect children through the maritalbond, and to be a responsible citizen through participation insociety's most venerated institution. In contrast, Justice Ken-nedy's concurrence in Din has remarkably little to say aboutthe importance of marriage for the individual or for society.Recall that the central claim in Din was whether Fauzia Dinwas entitled to a better reason than \"anti-terrorism\" for thegovernment's refusal to grant her husband a spousal visa tolive in the United States.19 6 One could imagine the JusticeKennedy of Obergefell discussing the right to spousal reunifica-tion in the same terms as he did there, something like this: Dinhad the right to choose whom she married; living with herhusband would offer her \"companionship and understandingand assurance that while both still live there will be someone tocare for the other\"; 19 7 having their father in their lives wouldnance and submission, in which decisionmakers of the present are required torespect a prior authority and [arel denied active collaboration in reshaping it.\").196 See Di, 135 S. Ct. at 2131-32.197 Obergefell v. Hodges, 135 S. Ct. 2584, 2600 (2015).2018]1 545CORNELL LAW REVIEWprotect any children they had from suffering \"the stigma ofknowing their families are somehow lesser\": and living as amarital unit would envelop Din and Berashk in the protectionof the \"social order.\"198 His Obergefell theory of marriage im-plies that married couples should be together (\"[m]arriage re-sponds to the universal fear that a lonely person might call outonly to find no one there\"19 9 ) and that marriage is an importantpart of cultural assimilation and civic participation-an impor-tant step, in the case of a naturalized citizen like Din andpotential immigrant like Berashk, in the couple's integrationinto the American polity.But Justice Kennedy's Din concurrence does no suchthing. Instead, the opinion barely mentions marriage at all.The concurrence finds it unnecessary to decide \"whether a citi-zen has a protected liberty interest in the visa application of heralien spouse\" because, \"even assuming she has such an inter-est, the Government satisfied due process when it notifiedDin's husband that his visa was denied under the immigrationstatute's terrorism bar.\"200 Kennedy's opinion then comparesDin's request for process to a similar request made by Ameri-can professors who wished to meet in person with a communistsympathizer in the 1972 case of Kletindienst v. MandeL20 1Mandel concerned Ernest Mandel, a Belgian citizen, pro-fessional journalist and editor-in-chief of La Gauche, the liter-ally-named Belgian Left Socialist weekly. 202 Mandel publisheda two-volume Marxist Economic Theory book in 1969.203 Al-though he claimed he was not a member of the CommunistParty, Mandel freely admitted that he was an advocate of theeconomic, governmental, and international doctrines of worldcommunism. Mandel intended to visit the United States tospeak at a conference on Technology and the Third World atStanford University. 204 When news of the conference becamepublic, he also received invitations to speak at Princeton, Am-herst, Columbia, and Vassar. 205 U.S. Immigration authoritiesdenied his visa request on the grounds that he previously vio-lated the terms of his visa. 206198 Id at 2590.199 Id. at 2600.200 Din, 135 S. Ct. at 2139 (Kennedy, J., concurring).201 See Kleindienst v. Mandel, 408 U.S. 753, 759-62 (1972).202 Id. at 756.203 Id.204 Id. at 757.205 Id.206 Id. at 755.546 [Vol. 103:501THE RIGHTS OF MARRIAGEThe claim at issue in the portion of the case that ultimatelyreached the Supreme Court was brought not by Mandel but bythe U.S. citizen professors who wished to hear him speak. Theprofessors claimed that their First Amendment right to associa-tion was abridged by their inability to meet Mandel in person(ultimately, he gave his lecture over the phone). 20 7 The Courtagreed that, all things being equal, it is easier to communicateand \"associate\" with someone in person. But scholarly ex-change can occur through reading translations of papers andbooks or through a phone conversation. 2 0 8 In Din, JusticeKennedy expressly analogizes the two cases: \"Like the profes-sors who sought an audience with Dr. Mandel, Din claims herconstitutional rights were burdened by the denial of a visa to anoncitizen, namely her husband. And as in Mandel, the Gov-ernment provided a reason for the visa denial: It concludedDin's husband was inadmissible under [the statute's] terrorismbar.\" 209 But although scholarly exchange can happen over thephone, it is difficult to imagine that marriage-at least, JusticeKennedy's Obergefell image of marriage-can work well thatway. What happened to the idea that marriage \"responds tothe universal fear that a lonely person might call out only tofind no one there\"? 2 10Contrasted with the soaring prose of Obergefell, the Dinconcurrence is surprisingly miserly. It seems inconceivablethat Justice Kennedy could really believe that the desire to bewith one's spouse is equivalent to the desire to engage in face-to-face academic debate. His Obergefell opinion describes mar-riage as so unique, special, and exalted in comparison withother very significant relationships that the move in Din tocompare marriage to a scholarly exchange is jarring. And yet,Justice Kennedy was likely drafting his opinions in Obergefelland Din nearly simultaneously.The clearest way to reconcile the two Kennedy opinions isto understand them both as conceiving of the individual as aresponsible citizen of the state. The virtue of marriage, accord-ing to the fourth principle outlined in the Obergefell opinion, isthat marriage is the \"building block of our national commu-nity\"; 2 11 by subjecting one's most personal relationship to thecontrol of the state, the individual furthers the state's projects207 Id. at 760.208 See id. at 765 (noting the Government's argument that books, speeches,and technological advancements may supplant physical presence).209 Kerry v. Din, 135 S. Ct. 2128, 2139-40 (2015).210 Obergefell v. Hodges, 135 S. Ct. 2584, 2600 (2015).211 Id. at 2601.2018]1 547CORNELL LAW REVIEWand contributes to the stability and security of all. Read thisway, the fourth principle of Obergefell is the most important,and the other three are simply supported by it. Din in turn isabout the security of the national community but in a verydifferent way: national security could be threatened by the pen-etration of the citizenry through the marriage of a citizen to aterrorist.2 12 Marriage, then, is an important exercise of self-expression and personal choice, but always within the contextof its greater purpose-to provide stability and structurethrough the social and legal control of a benign but powerfulsovereign.Indeed, Justice Kennedy's Din concurrence goes out of itsway to confine its holding to the counter-terrorism context.The opinion notes the exceptionalism of the statute underwhich Berashk was found inadmissible: only the counter-ter-rorism statute does not require the government to state withspecificity which provision of law made an alien inadmissi-ble. 2 1 3 The implication is that more process would be due if thegovernment interests were weaker. Terrorism alone stands asa ground for exclusion without a specific explanation. 2 14 Mar-riage supports good citizenship, but not at the expense of pub-lic safety.This reading is strengthened by turning to Justice Ken-nedy's majority opinion in Tuan Anh Nguyen v. United States, a2001 case concerning derivative citizenship. 2 15 In holding gen-der-discriminatory citizenship transmission laws constitu-tional, Justice Kennedy emphasized the importance of nationalcohesion and membership, and the facilitation of this tiethrough the parent-child bond. 216 For mothers, \"the opportu-nity for a meaningful relationship between citizen parent andchild inheres in the very event of birth,\" but \"[gliven the9-month interval between conception and birth, it is not al-ways certain that a father will know that a child was conceived,212 Ruthann Robson suggests that this interest in maintaining national bor-ders may also be an interest in maintaining racial purity. See Robson, supra note75, at 855 (\"This almost complete deference occurs not only in the context ofexecutive power but also with reference to the racialized subjects in this immigra-tion case, albeit without explicit references to race, only nationality.\"). For analy-sis of an historical analogue in the form of Japanese \"picture brides,\" see Abrams,Peaceful Penetration, supra note 189, at 143-54; for an analysis of similar restric-tions on Japanese war brides, see Villazor, supra note 190, at 1405-15.213 135 S. Ct. at 2140.214 I explore this aspect of Din in more detail in Abrams, Family Reunficationand the Security State, supra note 12, at 274-79.215 533 U.S. 53 (2001).216 Id at 63-65.548 [Vol. 103:501THE RIGHTS OF MARRIAGEnor is it always clear that even the mother will be sure of thefather's identity.\" 2 17 Citizenship is transmitted and exper-lenced, for Justice Kennedy, through relationships that shapeand sustain the citizen. The government's interest in a loyaland acculturated citizenry is \"too profound to be satisfiedmerely by conducting a DNA test.\"2 18 Justice Kennedy tiesfamily rights inextricably to the responsibilities of citizenship,whether it be citizenship in a community, a state, or a nation.Why does Justice Alito join Kennedy's concurrence in Din?Although we should not read too much into the Justice's deci-sion to join one opinion rather than another when we have noopinion of his own to consider, it does seem that there waseither something attractive to Justice Alito about Justice Ken-nedy's concurrence or something repugnant about JusticeScalia's plurality. Recall that Justice Alito was the only dis-senter in Obergefell who did not object to substantive due pro-cess in general, nor the \"right to marry\" articulated as asubstantive due process liberty interest in particular. 2 19 Incontrast to the other \"conservative\" Justices, Justice Alito'sconservatism appears to be about conservative values ratherthan a methodology-originalism-often associated with con-servatism. 220 Indeed, one amicus brief filed in Din on behalf ofFauzia Din was filed by several religious organizations, wholeveraged the constitutional family law canon, including Meyer,Pierce, and Moore, to support the notion that the traditionalfamily is protected both because of fundamental rights but alsobecause it is of \"societal value.\"22 1 Paying close attention toJustice Alito's dissent in Obergefell helps to identify the theo-retical commonalities with Kennedy's majority in that case.They come together in Din to simultaneously affirm the impor-tance of family while emphasizing duty to country and the exer-cise of responsible citizenship.217 I at 65.218 Id. at 67.219 135 S. Ct. 2584, 2640-43 (2015).220 Justice Alito's conservatism appears to transcend subject areas. See, e.g.,Gorod, supra note 163, at 369-72 (arguing that Justice Alito is more consistentlyconservative than Chief Justice Roberts); Michael McCall, Madhavi M. McCall &Christopher E. Smith, Criminal Justice and the 2014-15 United States SupremeCourt Term, 61 S.D. L.

Marriage as an Expectancy Interest in DinUnlike Justices Kennedy and Scalia, Justice Breyer did notwrite in both ObergefeUl and Din.2 2 2 He, along with JusticesGinsburg, Kagan, and Sotomayor, was silent in Obergefell,electing to join Justice Kennedy's majority opinion. 223 ButJustice Breyer did write a dissent in Din, joined by JusticesGinsburg, Kagan, and Sotomayor, and the theory of constitu-tional family law represented by that dissent stands in sharpcontrast to the one at play in both Kennedy's Obergefell major-ity opinion and his Din concurrence. 224Justice Breyer's Din dissent is best understood in light ofhis more general approach to constitutional questions. UnlikeJustices Scalia and Kennedy, Justice Breyer's approach to con-stitutional family law questions is difficult to ascertain. He hasnot written a single opinion in any of the major constitutionalfamily law or LGBTQ rights cases, and even in cases that pro-duced several opinions he has generally chosen to join theplurality or majority rather than join a concurrence or dissentor write one himself.2 2 5 The closest case we have is arguablyStenberg v. Carhart, in which the Justice wrote the majorityopinion in a case striking down a Nebraska statute thatcriminalized \"partial birth abortion,\" but even this case gives uslittle insight into how he would address issues of first impres-sion, as his method there was an application of the \"undueburden\" approach outlined in previous cases. 2 2 6 Understand-ing Justice Breyer's approach, then, requires taking a broaderlook at his jurisprudence outside the constitutional family lawcontext.Generally speaking, Justice Breyer's approach has beenincremental, pragmatic, and comfortable with understanding222 See 135 S. Ct. at 2591; 135 S. Ct. at 2130.223 See 135 S. Ct. at 2591.224 See 135 S. Ct. at 2141.225 See Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 60 (2000). Troxel generated one plu-rality opinion, two concurrences, and three dissents, but Justice Breyer signedonto Justice O'Connor's plurality opinion. See also United States v. Windsor, 133S. Ct. 2675, 2681 (2013) (Justice Breyer joined Justice Kennedy's majority opin-ion, with dissents filed by Justices Scalia, Thomas, and Alito, and Chief JusticeRoberts); Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 561 (2003) (Justice Breyer joinedJustice Kennedy's majority opinion, with a concurrence filed by Justice O'Connorand a dissent filed by Justice Scalia and joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist andJustice Thomas); M.L.B. v. S.L.J., 519 U.S. 102, 106 (1996) (Justice Breyer signedonto Ginsburg's majority opinion, with dissents filed by Justices Rehnquist andThomas and joined by Scalia).226 530 U.S. 914, 945-46 (2000).550 [Vol. 103:501THE RIGHTS OF MARRIAGErights as principles to be balanced with other factors. 2 2 7 Al-though in his book Active Liberty the Justice advocated for ananti-originalist, open-ended approach to constitutional adjudi-cation, his actual decisions have been marked less by expan-sive activism than by deep pragmatism and fact-baseddecision-making. 228 Facts always matter to Justice Breyer;simply saying that something is a \"constitutional right,\" forhim, begs the question of the whether the particular govern-ment activity in question violates that right.229Consider, for example, Justice Breyer's deciding votes intwo cases challenging public displays of the Ten Command-ments. In McCreary County v. ACLU, Justice Breyer went withthe five-Justice majority in invalidating a display of the TenCommandments in a Kentucky county court.230 The majorityopinion rejected the displays as violations of the First Amend-ment's prohibition of the establishment of religion. In contrast,in Van Orden v. Perry, he switched sides, writing a pluralityopinion comparing the history of the displays. 23 1 Because theTexas display had been donated by the Fraternal Order of Elks,had not been the subject of complaints or controversy for de-cades, and was situated among \"17 monuments and 21 histori-cal markers\" 2 3 2 -including heroes of the Alamo, Confederatesoldiers, and Texas schoolchildren-he found it not an estab-lishment of religion but instead meant to convey a secular mes-sage about the history of Texas.233McCreary and Van Orden both concerned a textual consti-tutional prohibition on the establishment of religion, but Jus-tice Breyer's pragmatic approach to constitutional law can alsoapply to implied rights and, indeed, appears to make him muchmore comfortable with the idea of \"proliferation\" of \"fundamen-tal\" rights than some of the other Justices. 2 3 4 If naming some-thing a fundamental right means that it trumps every other227 Consider, for example, Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 699-702 (2001) inwhich Breyer reads a six-month limitation into a statute providing for indefinitedetention of immigration detainees.228 See STEPHEN BREYER, AcTivE LIBERTY 116-20 (2005).229 See id. at 120-24 (explaining that in judicial decision making, JusticeBreyer emphasizes considerations of relevant circumstances and consequences).230 545 U.S. 844, 881 (2005).231 545 U.S. 677, 699-705 (2005) (Breyer, J., concurring) (Justice Breyer at-tached a map of the Capitol Monument to his opinion to show the context of thedisplay).232 Id. at 681.233 Id. at 703-04.234 See BREYER, supra note 228, at 132 (emphasizing that Justice Breyer viewsjudicial advancement of fundamental rights as a goal the Constitution seeks tofulfill).2018]1 551CORNELL LAW REVIEWinterest, then it follows that the number of fundamental rightsshould be small. In contrast, if, as Justice Breyer believes,designating something a fundamental right means that thegovernment's interest in abridging it must be balanced with theindividual's interest in the right, then a multitude of funda-mental rights is not as threatening. They may be fundamental,but they are far from absolute. In short, Justice Breyer's posi-tions have been notable for their focus on flexibility over for-malism, paying close attention to the specific circumstances ofparticular situations.2 3 5Justice Breyer's Din dissent squares with these jurispru-dential tendencies. At first, Justice Breyer sounds like hemight be starting to engage the same lionization of marriage asan institution that Justice Kennedy did in ObergefeL \"[Theinstitution of marriage, which encompasses the right ofspouses to live together and to raise a family, is central tohuman life, requires and enjoys community support, and playsa central role in most individuals' 'orderly pursuit of happi-ness.'\"236 But then the opinion turns sharply in another direc-tion. Immigration law, Justice Breyer contends, \"surroundsmarriage with a host of legal protections to the point that itcreates a strong expectation that government will not deprivemarried individuals of their freedom to live together withoutstrong reasons and (in individual cases) without fair proce-dure.\" 2 3 7 In other words, even if marriage were not a centrallyimportant institution, the law has made it so, and once peopledevelop legal expectations around what marriage means, thegovernment cannot arbitrarily deprive them of thoseexpectations.This vision is evident from the very way Justice Breyercharacterizes Din's claim. \"The liberty interest that Ms. Dinseeks to protect,\" he opines, \"consists of her freedom to livetogether with her husband in the United States.\"238 He thenhighlights the relatively narrow nature of her claim: \"She seeksprocedural, not substantive, protection for this freedom.\" 23 9Unlike the Obergefell majority, which sets marriage overand against other adult relationships as enduring, historically-235 See, e.g., Denver Area Educ. Telecomms. Consortium v. FCC, 518 U.S.727, 740-41 (1996) (characterizing First Amendment doctrine as having adoptedits principles \"to the balance of competing interests and the special circumstancesof each field of application\").236 Kerry v. Din, 135 S. Ct. 2128, 2142 (2015).237 1 at 2143.238 Id. at 2142.239 Id.[Vol. 103:501552THE RIGHTS OF MARRIAGErevered, and spiritually-significant institutions, the Din dissentunderstands civil marriage as a status created and recognizedby the state. Having \"surround[ed] marriage with a host oflegal protections,\" Justice Breyer explains, the state has cre-ated a \"strong expectation that government will not deprivemarried individuals of their freedom to live together withoutstrong reasons and (in individual cases) without fair proce-dure.\" 2 4 0 This emphasis on the state, rather than on the moralsuperiority of those who chose to marry, stands in stark con-trast to the Obergefell majority's view of marriage as a timeless,pre-legal institution that the state must acknowledge.The dissent adopts a version of the \"equal access\" argu-ment, advocated by scholars Nelson Tebbe and DeborahWidiss, although sounding in procedural due process morethan in equal protection. 2 4 1 Tebbe and Widiss argue against afundamental right to marry on the grounds that civil marriageis a \"government program that provides certain benefits andimposes certain obligations.\" 2 4 2 Civil marriage, they argue, isdifferent from \"other family-related liberties, such as rightsthat protect decisions regarding child rearing, procreation,contraception use, or termination of a pregnancy.\" 243 \"All ofthose rights exist independent of government involvement, andall of them enjoy protection against state interference undersubstantive due process doctrine.\" 24 4Tebbe and Widiss advocate for the use of equal protectiondoctrine to realize their \"equal access\" theory, and in the caseof same-sex marriage, that approach would make sense. In theDin dissent, where the problem was not obviously class-baseddiscrimination (although the case does have racial and na-tional-origin overtones), procedural due process is the mecha-nism, but equal access is still the theory. There, Justice Breyertakes the equal access argument to its logical conclusion, com-paring civil marriage to other rights or privileges grants to indi-viduals by the government, including the \"right not to besuspended from school class,\" \"a prisoner's right against invol-untary commitment,\" \"the right to welfare benefits,\" or the\"right not to take psychotropic drugs.\" 2 4 5 None of these rights240 Id. at 2143.241 Nelson Tebbe & Deborah A.

Ct. at 2143.5532018]1CORNELL LAW REVIEWis a \"fundamental right,\"2 46 protected by the Constitution.Rather, each is an example of a privilege that the governmenthas induced people to expect. 24 7 Once the governmentpromises such a privilege, it cannot arbitrarily deprive people ofit. This does not mean that the government cannot restrictthese rights, but it must provide \"due process\" in doing so.Surely, Justice Breyer argues, if the government provides pro-cedural due process when it deprives prisoners of \"'goodtime'credits\" that shorten their length of incarceration, or when aschool tries to suspend a student, it must provide processwhen it deprives a U.S. citizen of the \"freedom to live togetherwith her spouse in America.\"24 8Justice Breyer's conception of procedural due process isflexible. In some cases, such as criminal prosecutions, peopleare entitled to extensive process, including the right to counseland to confront the witnesses against them through cross-ex-amination. In other cases, procedural due process rights mightbe minimal. In Din's case, for example, she was not asking forfull-blown criminal due process rights, but something muchmore modest: an explanation. She wanted the government togive her more information about what her husband was ac-cused of doing. In other words, she wanted an explanation of\"lwhy the government acted as it did.\" 2 4 9 Properly apprised ofthe grounds for the Government's action,\" Justice Breyer ex-plains, \"Ms. Din can then take appropriate action-whetherthis amounts to an appeal, internal agency review, or (as islikely here) an opportunity to submit additional evidence andobtain reconsideration.\" 2 5 0 The reason that the governmentdid give-the terrorism grounds for inadmissibility-is notenough for Justice Breyer because it lacks specificity. Hewould give the government two options, either: (1) disclose thefacts that support the claim that Berashk was involved in ter-rorist activity or (2) disclose a \"sufficiently specific statutorysubsection that conveys effectively the same information.\" 2 5 1The issue here is not whether marriage is a fundamental right,but whether it is one of many, many interests that the govern-ment has chosen to protect. Yet, its fundamental nature hasrhetoric punch: \"How could a Constitution that protects indi-viduals against the arbitrary deprivation of so diverse a set of246 Id at 2142.247 Id. at 2143-44.248 Id at 2143.249 Id. at 2144.250 Id at 2145.251 Id at 2143.554 [Vol. 103:501THE RIGHTS OF MARRIAGEinterests not also offer some form of procedural protection to acitizen threatened with governmental deprivation of her free-dom to live together with her spouse in America?\" 252Notice what Breyer's opinion does not do-it does not cre-ate a fundamental right that can then be abridged only if thegovernment meets its burden under a strict scrutiny analy-sis.253 None of the Justices opining in these two marriagecases argues for this traditional approach (save those Justiceswho, in dissent, claim that the majorities could not have metthe burden such an approach would require). Justice Breyer'sDin dissent is not the traditional, three-tiers of scrutiny, funda-mental rights approach some scholars would prefer.254 Thetraditional approach, so long considered the bedrock of consti-tutional analysis in Fourteenth Amendment cases, is indeeddying, but not solely because of Justice Kennedy's looser for-mulations.2 55 Justice Breyer's approach is just as different inits own way.IVIMPLICATIONSIt is too soon to know what the long-term fallout from ei-ther of these decisions will be. Those who hoped that Dinwould sound the death knell of robust immigration power havebeen disappointed. Many who hoped that Obergefell would enddiscrimination against same-sex couples have been disturbedby the force of the backlash in the form of a call for religiousexemptions to anti-discrimination law. Anti-minority rhetoric,during and following the 2016 presidential election, hastargeted many groups, including the LGBTQ community andimmigrants. 256 Despite our limited ability to predict the future252 Id. at 2145.253 This change in approach, more commonly associated with Justice Ken-nedy, was presciently noticed by David Meyer in 2001 in his analysis of thefragmented decision in TroxeL \"Through the rising smoke of this battleground,\"he wrote, \"there emerges apparent consensus about a point of tremendous signifi-cance: The daunting complexity of family relationships commands special cautionand flexibility in formulating any constitutional rules of decision. This point isimportant because it signals an approach to family-privacy controversies that isquite different from the rigid, heavy-handed scrutiny prescribed by conventionalfundamental rights doctrine.\" Meyer, supra note 132, at 1146 (footnote omitted).254 Compare to the analysis in Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702 (1997).255 Indeed, consider Justice Kennedy's very traditional approach, using tieredscrutiny, in Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin, 133 S. Ct. 2411 (2016).256 See Elizabeth Sepper, Doctoring Discrimination in the Same-Sex MarriageDebates, 89 IND. L.J. 703, 703 (2014) (arguing \"that same-sex marriage objec-tions lack the distinct and compelling features of conscientious objection recog-nized by law\").2018]1 555CORNELL LAW REVIEWin 2018, however, reading Obergefell together with Din makeseach opinion take on a different cast than it does alone, andsimultaneously offers new arguments for the potential broad-ening and contracting of civil rights in the constitutional familycontext. This last Part takes up the possibility that readingObergefell and Din in light of each other points to markedlydifferent future outcomes than either case read alone.A. The Scope of Civil RightsFirst, the two cases read together indicate that the scope ofthe rights of unmarried people and the rights of LGBTQ peoplebeyond marriage may be different from what scholars havethought. Justice Kennedy's views on the importance of mar-riage appear even more focused on the constraining force ofresponsible citizenship when read in conjunction with Din. ButJustice Breyer's Din dissent provides a counterweight that maymore accurately reflect the opinions of the other Justices whojoined the majority in ObergefeLJustice Kennedy's ObergefeU opinion, taken alone, appearsto put unmarried people and their children in jeopardy. 257 In asociety in which over half of us are unmarried, and over 40% ofchildren are born to unmarried parents, a Supreme Courtopinion expressly preferring marriage to nonmarriage is of seri-ous concern.2 58 According to its critics, Obergefell suffers intwo respects-by denigrating parents who choose not to marry,and by denigrating unmarried people, with or without children,as inferior to married people.Scholars critiquing Obergefell along these lines worry thatprevious Supreme Court opinions that designated illegitimacyas a quasi-suspect classification for equal protection purposeswill be read in ways that castigate nonmarital families. Al-though this line of cases protected nonmarital children fromdiscrimination, their reasoning often included a \"the sins of theparents [should] not [be] visited [upon] their innocent children\"rationale. 259 Under this theory, illegitimacy could still be con-sidered an undesirable trait, and parents, but not their chil-dren, might still be punished for it or incentivized to marry.260257 See Huntington, supra note 10, at 23; Murray, supra note 10, at 1210.258 PEW RESEARCH CENTER, THE DECLINE OF MARRIAGE AND RISE OF NEW FAMIIUES 1,19-20 (2010), http: / /www.pewsocialtrends. org/files/20 10/11/pew-social-trends-2010-families.pdf [https://perma.ce/S5T3-EZ3J].259 Melissa Murray, What's So New About the New Illegitimacy?, 20 AM. U. J.GENDER, Soc. POLY & L. 387, 394 (2012).260 See Richard L. Brown, Disinheriting the \"Legal Orphan\": Inheritance Rightsof Children after Terrination of Parental Rights, 70 MO. L. REv. 125, 158 (2005)556 [Vol. 103:501THE RIGHTS OF MARRIAGEAs Professor Melissa Murray has noted, Justice Kennedy'srhetoric in Obergefell tilts strongly in the \"sins of the parents\"direction, asserting that \"children of nonmarital relationships'suffer the significant material costs of being raised by unmar-ried parents, relegated through no fault of their own to a moredifficult and uncertain family life.'\"26 1 Not only does Obergefelltreat the choice not to marry as \"utterly unimaginable,\" it alsodenigrates single people, whose \"intimate lives lack the dignity,transcendence, and purpose that come with knowing that theyare a part of a 'two-person union unlike any other in its impor-tance.'\"262 Thus, for Murray, Obergefell portrays marriage as\"the most profound, dignified, and fundamental institution intowhich individuals may enter\" and therefore implies that alter-natives to marriage are \"by comparison undignified, lessprofound, and less valuable.\"2 63Similarly, Clare Huntington has celebrated the outcome ofObergefell but lamented its reasoning. 26 According to Hunt-ington, the substantive due process analysis undertaken bythe Obergefell majority required the Court to define what mar-riage means and explain its social importance, and it chose todefine it in a constraining and conservative way. 2 6 5 An equalprotection analysis, instead, would have allowed the Court tobypass having to define marriage. Instead, the analysis couldhave simply been that \"whatever marriage means culturally, astate cannot deny access to it without distinctions that have astate (as opposed to a private, cultural) interest as a basis.\"266Instead, Justice Kennedy's majority opinion, Huntington ar-gues, is likely to further reify unfortunate aspects of family lawby reinforcing the notion that the \"typical\" family is married.26 7It is unclear, however, whether Obergefell's more effusivedescriptions, such as the infamous \"call[ing] out\" phrase 268 arecentral to the holding or mere rhetorical flourish. Even those(characterizing Supreme Court precedent as \"impatien[t] with statutes that pun-ish innocent children for the wrongdoing of their parents\"). But see Murray, supranote 259, at 394-99 (disputing conventional \"progress narrative\" of a \"more lib-eral era where the sins of the parents would not be visited upon the children\").261 Melissa Murray, supra note 10, at 1215 (quoting Obergefell v. Hodges, 135S. Ct. 2584, 2590 (2015)).262 Id. at 1215-16 (quoting Obergefell, 135 S.

Ct. 2584, 2600 (2015) (\"Marriage responds tothe universal fear that a lonely person might call out only to find no one there.\").2018]1 557CORNELL LAW REVIEWstatements that clearly are central, such as the assertion thatlack of access to marriage \"humiliates\" children of gay andlesbian couples, do not necessarily imply that discriminationagainst these couples would be constitutional were marriageavailable. 269 As Douglas NeJaime has observed, LGBTQ advo-cates have achieved increased protections for nonmaritalparenting simultaneous to and in conjunction with their advo-cacy around marriage equality. 270 Courtney Joslin has furtherargued that Obergefell, when read in light of the decriminaliza-tion of nonmarital sex set forth in cases such as Lawrence v.Texas, may stand for the proposition that \"our 'evolving exper-iences' must be considered,\" and that, given the large numberof unmarried Americans, our \"evolving experiences\" are likelyto include a recognition of the dignity of unmarried life. 2 7 1Adding Din complicates the equation. Justice Kennedy'sDin plurality sharply undercuts the scope of the marital rightshe affirmed in Obergefell by tying the enjoyment of these rightsto the exercise of responsible citizenship. The act of marryingis itself revealed to be just one way an individual can exerciseresponsible citizenship, and a very important one. Choosingnot to marry could very well be, for Justice Kennedy, an act ofirresponsibility, akin to Din's marriage to a suspected terrorist,that undercuts the claim to family-based rights.However, the Breyer dissent in Din suggests that the sup-port for a fundamental right of marriage among the Obergefellmajority Justices is more fractured and tenuous than the opin-ion on its face suggests. Understanding marriage as an expec-tancy interest puts it on much different footing thenunderstanding it as the means by which people discover theirmost evolved spiritual selves. To highlight the difference, let usconsider two quotations from the two opinions concerning thereason why the state supports marriage through benefits.First, Justice Kennedy:[Jiust as a couple vows to support each other, so does societypledge to support the couple, offering symbolic recognition269 See NeJaime, supra note 9, at 2347 (arguing that precedent may leadcourts to treat gays and lesbians as full participants in the space of nonmaritalparenthood); see also In re Brooke S.B., 61 N.E.3d 488, 498 (N.Y. 2016) (holdingthat the \"foundational premise of heterosexual parenting and nonrecognition ofsame-sex couples is unsustainable, particularly in light of the enactment of same-sex marriage ... and the ... holding in Obergefell v. Hodges ... which noted thatthe right to marry provides benefits not only for same-sex couples, but also thechildren being raised by those couples\").270 NeJaime, supra note 109, at 1187.271 Courtney G. Joslin, Marriage Equality and Its Relationship to Family Law,129 HARV. L. REv. FORUM 197, 211 (2016).558 [Vol. 103:501THE RIGHTS OF MARRIAGEand material benefits to protect and nourish the union. In-deed, while the States are in general free to vary the benefitsthey confer on all married couples, they have throughout ourhistory made marriage the basis for an expanding list of gov-ernmental rights, benefits, and responsibilities. 2 7 2Now, Justice Breyer:[The law, including visa law, surrounds marriage with a hostof legal protections to the point that it creates a strong expec-tation that government will not deprive married individuals oftheir freedom to live together without strong reasons and (inindividual cases) without fair procedure. 2 7 3For Kennedy, the primary reason that the government attachesbenefits of marriage is \"to protect and nourish the union.\" 274The government, remember, has a strong interest in social or-der and in preferring marriage over other social arrangements.For Breyer, the decision to tie benefits to marriage is morehistorically contingent: although marriage has played, and cur-rently does play, a central role in most individuals' \"orderlypursuit of happiness,\" 275 it is quite possible to imagine otherarrangements between individuals and the state that wouldfoster adult welfare and stability for children.Consider now the Chief Justice's mention in Obergefell ofan alternative argument that might have persuaded him: \"Theequal protection analysis might be different, in my view, if wewere confronted with a more focused challenge to the denial ofcertain tangible benefits.\"276 This statement, while somewhatcryptic, indicates at least openness to considering equal pro-tection claims brought by members of classes not deemed \"sus-pect.\" Thus, unmarried people themselves and not just theirchildren might be able to effectively bring claims of discrimina-tion if they could show that distinctions made on the basis ofmarital status are arbitrary, irrational, or based in animus.Similarly, the two cases read together point to a differentoutcome for the future of LGBTQ rights. During the Obergefelllitigation and after the opinions were issued, many scholarsand activists expressed concern that by reifying marriage, theObergefeU majority was limiting its holding to the marriagecontext. What about housing discrimination, employment dis-crimination, public harassment, hate crimes, and the many272 Obergefell, 135 S. Ct. at 2601.273 Kerry v. Din, 135 S. Ct. 2128, 2143 (2015).274 Obergefell, 135 S. Ct. at 2601.275 Din, 135 S. Ct. at 2143 (citing Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 399(1923)).276 Obergefell, 135 S. Ct. at 2623 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting).20 181] 559CORNELL LAW REVIEWother ways in which LGBTQ people are treated unequally? Andwhat about plaintiffs who did not \"perform\" traditional mar-riage and traditional values as well as Jim Obergefell and theother plaintiffs in the marriage cases? As Professor CaryFranklin put it, gaining the right to marry \"would benefit gaysand lesbians whose foremost desire was to settle down withsomeone of the same sex, 'adopt[] kids . . . go[ ] to church,coach[ ] little league, [and] collect[ ] stamps,\"' but would be lesshelpful and might even \"stigmatize-those whose interests ranto pursuits other than monogamy and stamp-collecting.\" 277As with the question of nonmarital families, the broaderquestion of LGBTQ rights looks different with Din in the mix.On a first reading, Din seems to strengthen Obergefells mar-riage exceptionalism. Justice Kennedy and Justice Alito'ssomewhat grudging acknowledgment of the marital rights ofimmigrants is an acknowledgment of marital rights, not cohab-itation rights. But once Justice Breyer's dissent is taken intoaccount, as well as Chief Justice Robert's short statement onequal protection in his Obergefell dissent, the future looks lessbleak for LGBTQ plaintiffs. Breyer and perhaps the other threeliberal Justices seem open to equal access claims that extendfar beyond marriage, and even Chief Justice Roberts is open toequal protection claims brought by members of non-suspectclasses. Granted, many of the claims that plaintiffs would bemost eager to make will not be constitutional ones. Most em-ployment discrimination and housing discrimination occursthrough private, not state, action, making the Equal Protectionclause inapplicable. But Title VII jurisprudence draws fromEqual Protection jurisprudence, and a different Obergefell-one that held that bans on same-sex marriage were unconsti-tutional because they discriminated based on sex-would havehad far-reaching implications for statutory anti-discriminationlaw.2 7 8 Justice Breyer's gesture toward an equal access ap-proach-even in a procedural due process, rather than equalprotection, context-gives credence to the notion that theCourt might apply its broad Obergefell holding, that discrimi-nation against LGBTQ people is irrational and robs them oftheir dignity, to a variety of other contexts. Indeed, at least one277 Cary Franklin, Marrying Liberty and Equality: The New Jurisprudence ofGay Rights, 100 VA. L. REv. 817, 824 (2014) (footnote omitted).278 Cunningham-Parmeter, supra note 10, at 1144-45 (arguing that \"the ques-tion of whether a public or private actor has intentionally discriminated againstan individual because of sex remains the same\" whether under the Constitutionor under Title VII, Title IX, the Fair Housing Act, the Equal Pay Act, or the EqualCredit Opportunity Act).560 [Vol. 103:501THE RIGHTS OF MARRIAGECourt has already cited Obergefell to support a Title VII claim.In EEOC v. Scott Medical Health Center, a district judge deniedthe defendant's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claimunder Title VII, holding that Title VII's \"because of sex\" provi-sion \"prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orienta-tion.\"2 7 9 The district judge went on to observe that:[Obergefell] demonstrates a growing recognition of the illegal-ity of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Thatsomeone can be subjected to a barrage of insults, humilia-tion, hostility and/or changes to the terms and conditions oftheir employment, based upon nothing more than the aggres-sor's view of what it means to be a man or a woman, is exactlythe evil Title VII was designed to eradicate. 2 8 0Were a case such as this one to be appealed to the current U.S.Supreme Court, Breyer's Din dissent suggests that at least fourof the Justices would have a more expansive view of LGBTQrights than the married-focused ones articulated by theObergefell majority.B. Family Reunification RightsPerhaps the most salient implication of Obergefell and Dinat the present is that U.S. citizens may have a cognizable con-stitutional claim for family reunification with their immigrantspouses and children. Prior to Din, this claim seemed out ofreach. Knauff Mezei, and the more recent Fiallo v. Bell,2 8 1appeared to foreclose arguments that family interests couldever outweigh federal immigration authority. Din, at the veryleast, created doubt. By holding that \"even assuming she hassuch an interest [in family reunification], the Government sat-isfied due process when it notified Din's husband that his visawas denied under the immigration statute's terrorism bar,\"2 8 2Justices Kennedy and Alito create the possibility that, underother circumstances, this interest could triumph. Context iscritical to the Din concurrence's logic; absent the counter-ter-rorism context, family reunification interest might outweighthe state's interest in exclusion.It is important not to overstate this possibility. Both Con-gress and the Executive typically receive far greater deference279 217 F. Supp. 3d 834, 839 (W.D. Pa. 2016).280 Id. at 842 (citation omitted).281 See Fiallo v. Bell, 430 U.S. 787 (1977). Schaughnessy v. United States exreL Mezei, 345 U.S. 206 (1953); United States ex reL Knauffv. Shaughnessy, 338U.S. 537 (1950).282 Kerry v. Din, 135 S. Ct. 2128, 2139 (2015) (Kennedy, J., concurring).20 181] 56 1CORNELL LAW REVIEW [Vol. 103:501when acting under their immigration powers than in other con-texts. 283 But in recent litigation over President Trump's \"travelban\" executive order, 28 4 Din has begun to play a role, andmight play a larger one in subsequent litigation.The initial Executive Order, among other things, sus-pended immigration from seven majority-Muslim nations forninety days.2 8 5 It was quickly challenged in court in severalstates. Unlike Din, the Order did not respond to a particularthreat by a particular person. Instead, it linked the ban to theSeptember 11, 2001 attacks of over sixteen years before andvague statements that terrorism had not been stopped.28 6Because so many individuals affected by the ban were al-ready in transit, family reunification did not come to the fore:the procedural due process claims for pre-vetted visa-holderswere far stronger and more-clear cut than nascent familyreunification claims.28 7 In addition, the President had soprominently advertised a pending \"Muslim ban\" during hiscampaign that the targeting of the seven countries in questionmade it easy for courts to find that litigants were likely tosucceed on the merits of their First Amendment EstablishmentClause claims. 288 Nonetheless, litigants did make these claims283 See Sarah H.

TheNinth Circuit recently hinted at this possibility in Washingtonv. Trump. There, the Government argued that the ExecutiveOrder did not violate procedural due process because the Gov-ernment was not enforcing it against lawful permanent re-sidents (\"green card\" holders) and only they had such rights.290The Ninth Circuit panel disagreed. Noncitizens beyond greencard holders might also have such rights, the court explained,including \"applicants who have a relationship with a U.S. resi-dent or an institution that might have rights of its own toassert.\" 29 1Obergefell provided the Justices of the Supreme Court anopportunity to think deeply about the meaning of marriage andwhether they believed it to be constitutionally protected or not.They were then able to simultaneously apply these under-standings to a different context. The robust marriage rightsoutlined in Obergefell found their way into Din, albeit in verydifferent forms. Together, these two cases could provide theammunition to overrule affirmatively Knauff and MezetCONCLUSIONToday we stand on the edge of what could be a very differ-ent constitutional era. Justice Scalia has passed away; manyof the Justices are of an age where death or retirement is likelyimminent; a new Justice, Neil Gorsuch, has taken JusticeScalia's seat; and our new President may well make furthernominations. It could be that the composition of the Court willchange so much in the next five years that the constitutionalfamily theories explored here will become less important.The positions staked out by the Justices on the currentCourt, however, are largely representative of the positions thathave been advocated by litigants, scholars, and amict in a vari-tions omitted)); see also Trump, 847 F.3d. at 1168 (finding that the state's Estab-lishment Clause claims \"raise serious allegations and present significantconstitutional questions\").289 See, e.g., Osman Nasreldin & Sahar Kamal Ahmed Fadul's Motion to Inter-vene at 1-2, Aziz, 234 F.

Regardless of which view can marshal a majority in anygiven case, these theories are likely to be the ones that domi-nate. One important implication of this Article is that it may bean individual Justice's theory of the relationship between theconstitution and the family that is most important in how he orshe will decide a particular case, rather than the specific testapplied. In other words, whether a Justice understands mar-riage as an exercise of citizenship, as a natural right, or as anexpectancy interest tells us more about how that Justice willbehave in future cases than whether he or she would apply thetraditional tiers of scrutiny or that equal protection or substan-tive due process is the more appropriate doctrine. Now thatfamily law has become constitutionalized, the Justices' per-sonal theories of the meaning of marriage and family will becritical in the development of constitutional family doctrine.Now that the Court has determined that there is a right tomarry, the next wave of cases will likely involve the rights ofmarriage.564 [Vol. 103:501",

    "abstract": "In the summer of 2015 the United States Supreme Court handed down two groundbreaking constitutional family law decisions. One decision became famous overnight Obergefell v. Hodges declared that same-sex couples have the constitutional right to marry. The other, Kerry v. Din, went largely overlooked. That later case concerned not the right to marry but the rights of marriage. In particular, it asked whether a person has a constitutional liberty interest in living with his or her spouse. This case is suddenly of paramount importance: executive orders targeting particular groups of immigrants implicate directly this right to family reunification.\nThis Article argues that neither Obergefell nor Din can be understood fully without the other. The constitutional issues in the cases-the right to marry and the rights of marriage stem from the same text and doctrines, implicate the same relationships, and reflect cultural understandings of the meaning of marriage and family. Read together, the two cases suggest that the rights of unmarried couples and LGBTQ people will be expanded-but only somewhat-by Obergefell and that the right to family reunification qualifes as a  right of marriage  under the Constitution",
